This is based on subgroup analyses of individual clinical trials rather than a formal synthesis of evidence for KRAS status as a predictive biomarker, while newer trials report no benefit for anti-EGFR antibodies irrespective of KRAS status. This study systematically reviewed the evidence for KRAS mutation status as a treatment effect modifier of response to anti-EGFR antibodies and the influence of partner chemotherapy. Methods: Medline (1966-2010), EMBASE and American and European oncology meeting abstracts were searched for randomised controlled trials reporting the influence of KRAS status on effectiveness of anti-EGFR antibodies in metastatic CRC. The treatment efficacy was summarised by KRAS status using hazard ratios (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) and risk differences (RD) for objective response. For each study, a measure of effect modification was calculated, and aggregated using random effects meta-analysis to assess the interaction between KRAS and treatment effect. Findings: Eleven studies (8924 patients) were selected from 198 reports. Two studies assessed anti-EGFR antibodies as monotherapy and nine their use with chemotherapy. KRAS status was reported in 7555 cases. In subgroup analysis, the progression HR for KRAS wild patients assigned to anti-EGFR antibodies was 0.80 (4436 patients 95\%CI: 0.64, 0.99) and for mutant cases 1.11 (3119 patients, 95\%CI: 0.97, 1.27). A significant treatment effect interaction between KRAS status and addition of anti-EGFR antibodies to standard treatment was found for PFS (ratio of HRs 0.71, 95\%CI: 0.57, 0.90 p = 0.005) and response rate difference (difference in RDs 15\%, 95\%CI: 8, 22\%, p {$<$} 0.001). There was no evidence that the extent of effect modification differed between chemotherapeutic partners for both PFS (p = 0.3) and response rate (p = 0.6). Interpretation: KRAS mutation status is a treatment effect modifier for anti-EGFR antibodies in metastatic CRC. Further evidence is needed to determine whether this is true for all chemotherapy partners and all clinical circumstances.},

  abstract = {The flipped classroom (FC) is a pedagogical model with an active learning concept and a hybrid course design that reverses the typical lecture process. Given the widespread use of online delivery methods, there is a need to explore the FC in delivering statistics courses. This study employs a prospective quasi-experimental study design to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped method and to compare it with the traditional method of teaching statistical data analysis software. Each of the 71 students enrolled in a medicine program was allocated to either a traditional classroom or a FC. The difference between the two teaching methods is evaluated using overall assessment performance as the main outcome measure. Our results show that the teaching method had a large and significant effect on assessment performance, with the FC method exhibiting a higher student overall performance than the traditional classroom. The data suggest integrating the FC in teaching statistical data analysis software is a helpful alternative to the traditional classroom. This study may serve as a guide and inspiration for educators in statistics courses to incorporate the concept of flipped learning, so as to engage students in a more active learning experience.},

In clinical practice it is helpful to label individuals as having or not having an attribute, such as being ``hypertensive'' or ``obese'' or having ``high cholesterol,'' depending on the value of a continuous variable. Categorisation of continuous variables is also common in clinical research, but here such simplicity is gained at some cost. Though grouping may help data presentation, notably in tables, categorisation is unnecessary for statistical analysis and it has some serious drawbacks. Here we consider the impact of converting continuous data to two groups (dichotomising), as this is the most common approach in clinical research.1 What are the perceived advantages of forcing all individuals into two groups? A common argument is that it greatly simplifies the statistical analysis and leads to easy interpretation and presentation of results. A {\dots}},

METHODS: A literature search identified 144 RCTs that involved 35,853 patients. The patient characteristics, trial designs, and methods for endpoint reporting were extracted. The clinical effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil or equivalent agents was analyzed in 3 time periods (pre-1990, 1990s, and 2000s) in 28,636 patients. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine trials (90\%) reported overall survival (OS) and response rates; whereas time to progression (44\%), duration of response (43\%), progression-free survival (22\%), and time to treatment failure (12\%) were reported less frequently. Except for stable and progressive disease, the frequency of reporting of endpoints did not improve over the period studied. The median OS for patients who received 5-fluorouracil or equivalent agents increased significantly (from 9.4 months before 1990 to 13.5 months after 2000). During the same period, the rate of stable disease increased (38.2\%, 40.5\%, and 45.1\% for pre-1990, 1990s, and 2000s, respectively; P = .004); whereas the rate of progressive disease decreased significantly (39.2\%, 33.3\%, and 27.8\%, respectively; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Its likely that the increasing availability of alternative treatments and better supportive care improved OS, whereas the rates of stable and progressive disease altered because of changes in follow-up schedules.

  abstract = {Assessing the calibration of methods for estimating the probability of the occurrence of a binary outcome is an important aspect of validating the performance of risk-prediction algorithms. Calibration commonly refers to the agreement between predicted and observed probabilities of the outcome. Graphical methods are an attractive approach to assess calibration, in which observed and predicted probabilities are compared using loess-based smoothing functions. We describe the Integrated Calibration Index (ICI) that is motivated by Harrell's Emax index, which is the maximum absolute difference between a smooth calibration curve and the diagonal line of perfect calibration. The ICI can be interpreted as weighted difference between observed and predicted probabilities, in which observations are weighted by the empirical density function of the predicted probabilities. As such, the ICI is a measure of calibration that explicitly incorporates the distribution of predicted probabilities. We also discuss two related measures of calibration, E50 and E90, which represent the median and 90th percentile of the absolute difference between observed and predicted probabilities. We illustrate the utility of the ICI, E50, and E90 by using them to compare the calibration of logistic regression with that of random forests and boosted regression trees for predicting mortality in patients hospitalized with a heart attack. The use of these numeric metrics permitted for a greater differentiation in calibration than was permissible by visual inspection of graphical calibration curves.},

A suitable way to analyze such data is through the use of multilevel regression models. These models incorporate cluster-specific random effects that allow one to partition the total variation in the outcome into between-cluster variation and between-individual variation. The magnitude of the effect of clustering provides a measure of the general contextual effect. When outcomes are binary or time-to-event in nature, the general contextual effect can be quantified by measures of heterogeneity like the median odds ratio or the median hazard ratio, respectively, which can be calculated from a multilevel regression model. Outcomes that are integer counts denoting the number of times that an event occurred are common in epidemiological and medical research. The median (incidence) rate ratio in multilevel Poisson regression for counts that corresponds to the median odds ratio or median hazard ratio for binary or time-to-event outcomes respectively is relatively unknown and is rarely used. The median rate ratio is the median relative change in the rate of the occurrence of the event when comparing identical subjects from 2 randomly selected different clusters that are ordered by rate. We also describe how the variance partition coefficient, which denotes the proportion of the variation in the outcome that is attributable to between-cluster differences, can be computed with count outcomes. We illustrate the application and interpretation of these measures in a case study analyzing the rate of hospital readmission in patients discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of heart failure.},

  abstract = {In survival analysis, time-varying covariates are covariates whose value can change during follow-up. Outcomes in medical research are frequently subject to competing risks (events precluding the occurrence of the primary outcome). We review the types of time-varying covariates and highlight the effect of their inclusion in the subdistribution hazard model. External time-dependent covariates are external to the subject, can effect the failure process, but are not otherwise involved in the failure mechanism. Internal time-varying covariates are measured on the subject, can effect the failure process directly, and may also be impacted by the failure mechanism. In the absence of competing risks, a consequence of including internal time-dependent covariates in the Cox model is that one cannot estimate the survival function or the effect of covariates on the survival function. In the presence of competing risks, the inclusion of internal time-varying covariates in a subdistribution hazard model results in the loss of the ability to estimate the cumulative incidence function (CIF) or the effect of covariates on the CIF. Furthermore, the definition of the risk set for the subdistribution hazard function can make defining internal time-varying covariates difficult or impossible. We conducted a review of the use of time-varying covariates in subdistribution hazard models in articles published in the medical literature in 2015 and in the first 5 months of 2019. Seven percent of articles published included a time-varying covariate. Several inappropriately described a time-varying covariate as having an association with the risk of the outcome.},

We describe three families of regression models for the analysis of multilevel survival data. First, Cox proportional hazards models with mixed effects incorporate cluster-specific random effects that modify the baseline hazard function. Second, piecewise exponential survival models partition the duration of follow-up into mutually exclusive intervals and fit a model that assumes that the hazard function is constant within each interval. This is equivalent to a Poisson regression model that incorporates the duration of exposure within each interval. By incorporating cluster-specific random effects, generalised linear mixed models can be used to analyse these data. Third, after partitioning the duration of follow-up into mutually exclusive intervals, one can use discrete time survival models that use a complementary log--log generalised linear model to model the occurrence of the outcome of interest within each interval. Random effects can be incorporated to account for within-cluster homogeneity in outcomes. We illustrate the application of these methods using data consisting of patients hospitalised with a heart attack. We illustrate the application of these methods using three statistical programming languages (R, SAS and Stata).},

  abstract = {Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies. In medical and epidemiological studies, outcomes are frequently time-to-event in nature. Propensity-score methods are often applied incorrectly when estimating the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes. This article describes how two different propensity score methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting) can be used to estimate the measures of effect that are frequently reported in randomized controlled trials: (i) marginal survival curves, which describe survival in the population if all subjects were treated or if all subjects were untreated; and (ii) marginal hazard ratios. The use of these propensity score methods allows one to replicate the measures of effect that are commonly reported in randomized controlled trials with time-to-event outcomes: both absolute and relative reductions in the probability of an event occurring can be determined. We also provide guidance on variable selection for the propensity score model, highlight methods for assessing the balance of baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects, and describe the implementation of a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of unmeasured confounding variables on the estimated treatment effect when outcomes are time-to-event in nature. The methods in the paper are illustrated by estimating the effect of discharge statin prescribing on the risk of death in a sample of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. In this tutorial article, we describe and illustrate all the steps necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes. {\copyright} 2013 The authors.

  abstract = {The hazard function plays a central role in survival analysis. In a homogeneous population, the distribution of the time to event, described by the hazard, is the same for each individual. Heterogeneity in the distributions can be accounted for by including covariates in a model for the hazard, for instance a proportional hazards model. In this model, individuals with the same value of the covariates will have the same distribution. It is natural to think that not all covariates that are thought to influence the distribution of the survival outcome are included in the model. This implies that there is unobserved heterogeneity; individuals with the same value of the covariates may have different distributions. One way of accounting for this unobserved heterogeneity is to include random effects in the model. In the context of hazard models for time to event outcomes, such random effects are called frailties, and the resulting models are called frailty models. In this tutorial, we study frailty models for survival outcomes. We illustrate how frailties induce selection of healthier individuals among survivors, and show how shared frailties can be used to model positively dependent survival outcomes in clustered data. The Laplace transform of the frailty distribution plays a central role in relating the hazards, conditional on the frailty, to hazards and survival functions observed in a population. Available software, mainly in R, will be discussed, and the use of frailty models is illustrated in two different applications, one on center effects and the other on recurrent events.},

Such data could inform current healthcare guidance and transition to adult services. We aimed to explore the lived experience of adolescents with SRS. Design/setting/patients In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted between January 2015 and October 2016 with a sample of eight adolescents aged 13--18 (five girls) with genetically confirmed SRS from the UK. Qualitative interviews were transcribed and coded to identify similarities and differences using thematic analysis; codes were then grouped to form overarching themes. Results We identified four themes from the interview data: (1) the psychosocial challenges of feeling and looking different; (2) pain, disability and fatigue; (3) anticipated stigma; and (4) building resilience and acceptance. Despite adolescents accepting SRS in their lives, they described ongoing psychosocial challenges and anticipated greater problems to come, such as stigma from prospective employers. Conclusions Adolescents with SRS may experience psychosocial difficulties from as young as 10 years old related to feeling and looking different; pain, disability and fatigue; anticipated stigma; and future challenges around employment. We discuss these findings in relation to recommendations for the care of adolescents with SRS to prepare them for adult life.},

There was a wide variation in presentation between journals, with the range of ideal presentation from a low of 53\% (               JAMA               ) to a high of 80\% (               Lancet Planetary Health               ).                                         Conclusions               : Many percents did not adhere to the guidelines on using decimal places. Using the recommended number of decimal places would make papers easier to read and reduce the burden on readers, and potentially improve comprehension. It should be possible to provide automated feedback to authors on which numbers could be better presented.},

  abstract = {Background Multiple-arm randomized trials can be more complex in their design, data analysis, and result reporting than two-arm trials. We conducted a systematic review to assess the reporting of analyses in reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with multiple arms. Methods The literature in the MEDLINE database was searched for reports of RCTs with multiple arms published in 2009 in the core clinical journals. Two reviewers extracted data using a standardized extraction form. Results In total, 298 reports were identified. Descriptions of the baseline characteristics and outcomes per group were missing in 45 reports (15.1\%) and 48 reports (16.1\%), respectively. More than half of the articles (n = 171, 57.4\%) reported that a planned global test comparison was used (that is, assessment of the global differences between all groups), but 67 (39.2\%) of these 171 articles did not report details of the planned analysis. Of the 116 articles reporting a global comparison test, 12 (10.3\%) did not report the analysis as planned. In all, 60\% of publications (n = 180) described planned pairwise test comparisons (that is, assessment of the difference between two groups), but 20 of these 180 articles (11.1\%) did not report the pairwise test comparisons. Of the 204 articles reporting pairwise test comparisons, the comparisons were not planned for 44 (21.6\%) of them. Less than half the reports (n = 137; 46\%) provided baseline and outcome data per arm and reported the analysis as planned. Conclusions Our findings highlight discrepancies between the planning and reporting of analyses in reports of multiple-arm trials.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pharmacological poisonings in young children are avoidable. Previous studies report calls to poisons centres, presentations to emergency departments (ED) or hospital admissions. There are limited data assessing concurrent management of poisonings across all three settings. We aimed to describe accidental pharmacological poisonings in young children across our Poisons Information Centre (PIC), EDs and hospitals. METHODS: A population-based study in New South Wales, Australia, of PIC calls, ED presentations and hospital admissions for accidental pharmacological poisoning in children aged {$<$}5 years, 2007-2013. We examined trends, medicines responsible and subsequent management. Medicines were coded using ICD10-AM diagnosis codes (T36-50). RESULTS: Over 2007-2013, pharmacological poisonings accounted for 67,816 PIC calls, 7739 ED presentations and 2082 admissions. Rates (per 10,000 children) of PIC calls declined from 220 to 178; ED presentations were stable ({$\sim$}22-24), with a decrease in emergency cases offset by an increase in semi- or non-urgent presentations; hospital admissions declined (8-5). Most PIC calls related to "non-opioid analgesics" (25\%), and "topical agents" (18\%). Nearly every day, one child aged {$<$}5 years was admitted to hospital for poisoning. "Benzodiazepines", "other and unspecified antidepressants", "uncategorised antihypertensives", and "4-aminophenol derivatives" accounted for over one-third of all admissions. Most PIC calls (90\%) were advised to stay home, 6\% referred to hospital. One-quarter of ED presentations resulted in admission. CONCLUSIONS: Poisonings reported to PIC and hospitals declined, however, non-urgent ED presentations increased. Strategies to reduce therapeutic errors and access to medicines, and education campaigns to improve Poisons Centre call rates to prevent unnecessary ED presentations are needed.},

Method Data from 15 longitudinal multi-centre psycho-oncology studies were analysed, and variance components including ICCs were estimated. Studies with psychosocial outcomes that had at least one measurement post-baseline including individual randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised trials and observational studies were included. Results Variance components and ICCs from 87 outcome measures were estimated. The unadjusted, single timepoint (first post-baseline) ICCs ranged from 0 to 0.16, with a median value of 0.022 and inter-quartile range 0 to 0.0605. The longitudinal ICCs ranged from 0 to 0.09 with a median value of 0.0007 and inter-quartile range 0 to 0.018. Conclusions Although the magnitude of variance components and ICCs used for sample--size calculation cannot be known in advance of the study, published estimates can help reduce the uncertainty in sample-size calculations. Psycho-oncology researchers should be conservative in their sample-size calculations and use approaches that improve efficiency in their design and analysis.

It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation. Whereas the design shares many properties of regression-based approaches in other epidemiological studies, there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations. In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.},

However, often critical information on directions for use and the intended duration of medicine supply are not available. In the absence of this information, alternative approaches are needed to support the assignment of exposure periods. This study summarises the key methods commonly used to estimate medicine exposure periods and dose from pharmaceutical claims data; and describes a method using individualised dispensing patterns to define time-dependent estimates of medicine exposure and dose. This method extends on important features of existing methods and also accounts for recent changes in an individual's medicine use. Specifically, this method constructs medicine exposure periods and estimates the dose used by considering characteristics from an individual's prior dispensings, accounting for the time between prior dispensings and the amount supplied at prior dispensings. Guidance on the practical applications of this method is also provided. Although developed primarily for application to databases, which do not contain duration of supply or dose information, use of this method may also facilitate investigations when such information is available and there is a need to consider individualised and/or changing dosing regimens. By shifting the reliance on prescribed duration and dose to determine exposure and dose estimates, individualised dispensing information is used to estimate patterns of exposure and dose for an individual. Reflecting real-world individualised use of medicines with complex and variable dosing regimens, this method offers a pragmatic approach that can be applied to all medicine classes.}

This study estimated retention in buprenorphine and methadone treatment and its relationship with person, treatment and prescriber characteristics. Design: Retrospective longitudinal study. Setting: New South Wales, Australia. Participants: People entering the opioid agonist treatment programme for the first time between August 2001 and December 2015. Measurements: Time in opioid agonist treatment (primary outcome) was modelled using a generalized estimating equation model to estimate associations with person, treatment and prescriber characteristics. Findings: The impact of medication type on opioid agonist treatment retention reduced over time; the risk of leaving treatment when on buprenorphine compared with methadone was higher among those who entered treatment earlier [e.g. 2001--03: odds ratio (OR) = 1.59, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.45--1.75] and lowest among those who entered most recently (2013--15: OR = 1.23, 95\% CI = 1.11--1.36). In adjusted analyses, risk of leaving was reduced among people whose prescriber had longer tenure of prescribing (e.g. 3 versus 8 years: OR = 0.94, 95\% CI = 0.93--0.95) compared with prescribers with shorter tenure. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, being of younger age, past-year psychosis disorder and having been convicted of more criminal charges in the year prior to treatment entry were associated with increased risk of leaving treatment. Conclusion: In New South Wales, Australia, retention in buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence, compared with methadone, has improved over time since its introduction in 2001. Opioid agonist treatment retention is affected not only by characteristics of the person and his or her treatment, but also of the prescriber, with those of longer prescribing tenure associated with increased retention of people in opioid agonist treatment.}

This study addresses this gap using a cohort of 37,994 PWOD initiating opioid analgesics between July 2003 and July 2018 in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Linked administrative records provided data on dispensings, sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, OAT, and mortality. Cox proportional hazards models assessed associations between time-varying measures of individual and concurrent medicine use and OAT with all-cause mortality, accidental opioid overdose, non-drug induced accidents, and non-drug-induced suicide. Opioid analgesic dose effects, expressed as oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) per day, were also examined. Outcomes: During the study period, 3167 individuals died. Compared with no use, all medicines of interest were associated with increased accidental opioid overdose risk; hazard ratios (HR) ranged from 1.33 (95 \% CI: 1.05--1.68) for opioid analgesic use to 6.10 (95 \% CI: 4.11--9.06) for opioid analgesic, benzodiazepine and gabapentinoid use. Benzodiazepine use was associated with increased non-drug-induced accidents and non-drug-induced suicides. For all-cause mortality, all combinations of benzodiazepines and gabapentinoids with opioid analgesics were associated with increased risk (aHRs ranged from 1.35 to 2.73). For most medicines/medicine combinations, all-cause mortality risk was reduced when in OAT compared to out of OAT. Higher opioid analgesic doses were associated with increased all-cause mortality (e.g., 90--199 mg vs 1--49 mg OME per day: HR 1.90 [95 \% CI: 1.52--2.40]). Interpretation: The increased mortality risk associated with benzodiazepines and gabapentinoids among PWOD appear to be reduced when engaged in OAT. A greater focus on encouraging OAT engagement, providing overdose prevention education, and access and coverage of overdose antidotes is necessary to minimise the unintended consequences of medicines use in this population.}

Methods: Retrospective cohort study in New South Wales, Australia, including 28,891 people with documented opioid dependence initiating opioid analgesics between July 2003 and December 2018. Linked administrative records provided data on prescription dispensings, sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, and OAT. Generalised estimating equation models estimated the incidence and adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing periods in and out of OAT for the number of opioid analgesic dispensings (overall, for strong opioids, and the most commonly dispensed opioid types) and the amount dispensed in oral morphine equivalent milligrams (OME). Results: At initiation, 43.7\% of the cohort were enrolled in OAT. The most commonly initiated opioid was codeine (including combinations with paracetamol; 67.8\%), and 49.6\% of the cohort were dispensed a psychotropic medicine in the previous 90 days. Incidence of all opioid analgesic dispensings was higher during periods out of OAT compared to in OAT (5.8 v. 2.3 dispensings per person-year; IRR 0.39, 95\% CI 0.38, 0.41), with findings similar when stratified by type. Being in OAT was associated with a lower OME amount dispensed compared to out of OAT (-57.7\%, 95\% CI-58.8, -56.7). Conclusions: People with opioid dependence had high rates of recent psychotropic medicine utilisation and current OAT enrolment at the time of opioid analgesic initiation. OAT was associated with a significant reduction in opioid analgesic dispensing.}

  abstract = {Background: Longer retention in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is associated with improved treatment outcomes but 12-month retention rates are often low. Innovative approaches are needed to strengthen retention in OAT. We develop and compare traditional and deep learning-extensions of Cox regression to examine the potential for predicting time in OAT at individuals' first episode entry. Methods: Retrospective cohort study in New South Wales, Australia including 16,576 people entering OAT for the first time between January 2006 and December 2017. We develop 12-month OAT cessation prediction models using traditional and deep learning-extensions of the Cox regression algorithm with predictors evaluated from linked administrative datasets. Proportion of explained variation, calibration, and discrimination are compared using 5 {\texttimes} 2 cross-validation. Results: Twelve-month cessation rate was 58.4\%. The largest hazard ratios for earlier cessation from the deep learning model were observed for treatment factors, including private dosing points (HR=1.54, 95\% CI=1.49--1.60) and buprenorphine medication (HR=1.43, 95\% CI=1.39--1.46). Diagnostic codes for homelessness (HR=1.09, 95\% CI=1.04--1.13), outpatient treatment for drug use disorders (HR=1.10, 95\% CI=1.06--1.15), and occupant of vehicle accident (HR=1.04, 95\% CI=1.01--1.07) from past-year health service presentations were identified as significant predictors of retention. We observed no improvement in performance of the deep learning model over traditional Cox regression. Conclusions: Deep learning may be more useful in identifying novel risk factors of OAT retention from administrative data than evaluating individual-level risk. An increased focus on addressing structural issues at the population level and considering alternate models of care may be more effective at improving retention than delivering fully personalised OAT.}

  abstract = {Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, with significant clinical and economic burdens, largely driven by adverse cardiovascular outcomes and AF-related hospitalization. Left atrial (LA) parameters have been shown to have prognostic value in cardiovascular disease states. We sought to evaluate the prognostic value of measures of LA size and function, as measured through LA volume index and LA emptying fraction (LAEF), respectively, for AF rehospitalization and long-term adverse outcomes in patients with nonvalvular AF following index hospitalization. Methods: In this retrospective study, 594 consecutive patients (mean age, 67.8 {\textpm} 13.6 years, 53\% men) admitted to a tertiary referral center with nonvalvular AF were assessed. Patients who underwent transthoracic echocardiography during their index admission and had complete follow-up data were included and followed for a mean period of 33.18 {\textpm} 21.27 months for the primary outcome of AF rehospitalization. The secondary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events. Results: The primary outcome occurred in 250 (42\%) patients, and the secondary outcome occurred in 219 (37\%) patients. On multivariable regression analysis, LAEF had an independent association with AF rehospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.967; 95\% CI, 0.953-0.982; P {$<$}.01), and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated LAEF to have strong diagnostic accuracy in predicting early and intermediate AF rehospitalization. Both LA volume index (HR = 1.014; 95\% CI, 1.003-1.026; P =.01) and LAEF (HR = 0.982; 95\% CI, 0.970-0.993; P {$<$}.01) were associated with all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events. Conclusions: Adverse LA remodeling, as reflected through LA enlargement and reduced LA mechanical function, is associated with AF rehospitalization and long-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes in hospitalized patients with nonvalvular AF.}

The heterogeneous etiology of CS makes decisions regarding treatment for such patients challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of left atrial (LA) function in the identification of cardioembolism and prediction of outcomes in patients with CS. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary institution with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) who underwent transthoracic echocardiography were recruited, with comprehensive evaluation of LA metrics including LA strain. Ischemic strokes and TIAs were classified as noncardioembolic, cryptogenic, or cardioembolic. A total of 709 patients (mean age, 66.0 {\textpm} 15.1 years; 55\% men) were recruited. Two hundred ninety-one patients had CS, 189 had noncardioembolic stroke, and 229 had cardioembolic stroke. Patients with CS were followed for 20.0 {\textpm} 13.8 months for recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA. Results: Receiver operating characteristic curves showed LA reservoir and contractile strain to be strong discriminators of cardioembolic strokes, and log-rank tests showed both measures to be significantly associated with the distribution of time to recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA in patients with CS. Multivariable hazard models showed LA reservoir and contractile strain to be independent predictors of recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA in patients with CS, in addition to estimated glomerular filtration rate and active smoking. Conclusions: LA reservoir and contractile strain were strong discriminators of cardioembolic stroke and independently predicted recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA in patients with CS. Use of LA strain may improve risk stratification and decision-making in patients with CS, with particular regard to prolonged ambulatory heart rhythm monitoring and/or empiric anticoagulation.}

  abstract = {Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent disease with associated mortality risk, mediated in large part through its associated cardiovascular risk factors. Standard modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (SMuRFs; hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes and smoking) are established drivers of cardiovascular disease; however, the importance of non-traditional mediators of cardiovascular risk (NTRFs) such as chronic renal impairment, obstructive sleep apnoea and obesity is emerging. The differential impact of these risk factors on outcomes in patients with AF is not well studied. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to our service between January 2013 and January 2018 with a primary diagnosis of non-valvular AF were assessed. Assessment of demographic, anthropometric, risk factor profile and pharmacotherapeutics was performed. The clinical course of these patients was followed for up to five years for the composite outcome of all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events. Results: Of the 1010 patients (62.29~{\textpm}~16.81~years, 51\% men) included, 154 (15\%) had no risk factors, 478 (47\%) had only SMuRFs, 59 (6\%) had only NTRFs and 319 (32\%) had both SMuRFs and NTRFs. Over a mean follow-up period of 33.18 {\textpm} 21.27~months, a total of 288 patients met the composite outcome. On Cox regression, the coexistence of SMuRFs and NTRFs was an independent predictor of the composite outcome (HR 1.40; 95\%CI 1.09--1.82, p~=.01). Other independent predictors included age, heart failure, CHA2DS2VASc score, persistent AF and anaemia. Conclusions: The presence of both SMuRFs and NTRFs has prognostic implications in patients with non-valvular AF.}

  abstract = {In observational studies, many continuous or categorical covariates may be related to an outcome. Various spline-based procedures or the multivariable fractional polynomial (MFP) procedure can be used to identify important variables and functional forms for continuous covariates. This is the main aim of an explanatory model, as opposed to a model only for prediction. The type of analysis often guides the complexity of the final model. Spline-based procedures and MFP have tuning parameters for choosing the required complexity. To compare model selection approaches, we perform a simulation study in the linear regression context based on a data structure intended to reflect realistic biomedical data. We vary the sample size, variance explained and complexity parameters for model selection. We consider 15 variables. A sample size of 200 (1000) and R2 = 0.2 (0.8) is the scenario with the smallest (largest) amount of information. For assessing performance, we consider prediction error, correct and incorrect inclusion of covariates, qualitative measures for judging selected functional forms and further novel criteria. From limited information, a suitable explanatory model cannot be obtained. Prediction performance from all types of models is similar. With a medium amount of information, MFP performs better than splines on several criteria. MFP better recovers simpler functions, whereas splines better recover more complex functions. For a large amount of information and no local structure, MFP and the spline procedures often select similar explanatory models. Copyright {\copyright} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Maintaining the prechosen Type I error level is challenging when outcomes are correlated. This problem concerns many research areas, including neuropsychological research in which multiple, interrelated assessment measures are common. Standard p value adjustment methods include Bonferroni-, Sidak-, and resampling-class methods. In this report, the authors aimed to develop a multiple hypothesis testing strategy to maximize power while controlling Type I error. The authors conducted a sensitivity analysis, using a neuropsychological dataset, to offer a relative comparison of the methods and a simulation study to compare the robustness of the methods with respect to varying patterns and magnitudes of correlation between outcomes. The results lead them to recommend the Hochberg and Hommel methods (step-up modifications of the Bonferroni method) for mildly correlated outcomes and the step-down minP method (a resampling-based method) for highly correlated outcomes. The authors note caveats regarding the implementation of these methods using available software. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prescription drug misuse is a growing public health concern globally. Routinely collected data provide a valuable tool for quantifying prescription drug misuse. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the global literature investigating prescription drug misuse utilizing routinely collected, person-level prescription/dispensing data to examine reported measures, documented extent of misuse and associated factors. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, MEDLINE In Process, Scopus citations and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant articles published between 1 January 2000 and 31 July 2013. A total of 10,803 abstracts were screened and 281 full-text manuscripts were retrieved. Fifty-two peer-reviewed, English-language manuscripts met our inclusion criteria-an aim/method investigating prescription drug misuse in adults and a measure of misuse derived exclusively from prescription/dispensing data. RESULTS: Four proxies of prescription drug misuse were commonly used across studies: number of prescribers, number of dispensing pharmacies, early refills and volume of drugs dispensed. Overall, 89 unique measures of misuse were identified across the 52 studies, reflecting the heterogeneity in how measures are constructed: single or composite; different thresholds, cohort definitions and time period of assessment. Consequently, it was not possible to make definitive comparisons about the extent (range reported 0.01-93.5~\%), variations and factors associated with prescription drug misuse. CONCLUSIONS: Routine data collections are relatively consistent across jurisdictions. Despite the heterogeneity of the current literature, our review identifies the capacity to develop universally accepted metrics of misuse applied to a core set of variables in prescription/dispensing claims. Our timely recommendations have the potential to unify the global research field and increase the capacity for routine surveillance of prescription drug misuse.},

Using extracts from real studies, the author illustrates how data can be employed correctly and incorrectly in medical research helping readers to evaluate the statistics they encounter and appropriately implement findings in clinical practice.   End of chapter exercises, case studies and multiple choice questions help readers to apply their learning and develop their own interpretative skills. This thoroughly revised edition includes new chapters on meta-analysis, missing data, and survival analysis.},

Methods We give several examples where this has been done. We use simulation to demonstrate that the procedure is invalid and also show this algebraically. Results This approach is biased and invalid, producing conclusions which are, potentially, highly misleading. The actual alpha level of this procedure can be as high as 0.50 for two groups and 0.75 for three. Conclusions Randomised groups should be compared directly by two-sample methods and separate tests against baseline are highly misleading.},

  abstract = {In some comparisons - for example, between two means or two proportions - there is a choice between two sided or one sided tests of significance (all comparisons of three or more groups are two sided). * This is the eighth in a series of occasional notes on medical statistics. When we use a test of significance to compare two groups we usually start with the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the populations from which the data come. If this hypothesis is not true the alternative hypothesis must be true - that there is a difference. Since the null hypothesis specifies no direction for the difference nor does the alternative hypothesis, and so we have a two sided test. In a one sided test the alternative hypothesis does specify a direction - for example, that an active treatment is better than a placebo. This is sometimes justified by saying that we are not interested in the possibility that the active treatment is worse than no treatment. This possibility is still part of {\dots}},

To explore the methodological components of pilot/feasibility studies and how they inform full RCTs. Study design Cross-sectional study. Setting Both groups included NIHR HTA programme funded studies in the period 1 January 2010--31 December 2014 (decision date). Group 1: stand-alone pilot/feasibility studies published in the HTA Journal or accepted for publication. Group 2: all funded RCT applications funded by the HTA programme, including reference to an internal and/or external pilot/feasibility study. The methodological components were assessed using an adapted framework from a previous study. Main outcome measures The proportion of stand-alone pilot and feasibility studies which recommended proceeding to full trial and what study elements were assessed. The proportion of `HTA funded' trials which used internal and external pilot and feasibility studies to inform the design of the trial. Results Group 1 identified 15 stand-alone pilot/feasibility studies. Study elements most commonly assessed were testing recruitment (100\% in both groups), feasibility (83\%, 100\%) and suggestions for further study/investigation (83\%, 100\%). Group 2 identified 161 `HTA funded' applications: 59 cited an external pilot/feasibility study where testing recruitment (50\%, 73\%) and feasibility (42\%, 73\%) were the most commonly reported study elements: 92 reported an internal pilot/feasibility study where testing recruitment (93\%, 100\%) and feasibility (44\%, 92\%) were the most common study elements reported. Conclusions `HTA funded' research which includes pilot and feasibility studies assesses a variety of study elements. Pilot and feasibility studies serve an important role when determining the most appropriate trial design. However, how they are reported and in what context requires caution when interpreting the findings and delivering a definitive trial.},

Data visualised in tables (and graphs) are key components in any scientific report, but their design leaves much to be desired. This article focuses on table design, following two general principles: clear vision and clear understanding. Clear vision is achieved by maximising the signal to noise ratio. In a table, the signal is the data in the form of numbers, and the noise is the support structure necessary to interpret the numbers. Clear understanding is achieved when the story in the data is told effectively, through organisation of the data and use of text. These principles are illustrated by original and improved tables from recent publications. Two special cases are discussed separately: tables produced by the pharmaceutical industry (in clinical study reports and reports to data safety monitoring boards), and study flow diagrams as proposed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses initiatives.},

Because of randomisation the null hypothesis is true for baseline comparisons and therefore any differences will occur by chance. However, this is only the case if allocations are not known in advance of recruitment. If this occurs then selection bias at randomisation may be present and it is possible that the statistical testing of covariates may unveil selection bias. In this paper we show that this is particularly the case for cluster randomised trials when post-randomised recruitment often occurs and can lead to selection bias.},

The epidemiology of travel behaviours among Grade 6, 8 and 10 students in NSW is reported. Methods:~ A representative population survey of students in NSW, Australia was conducted during February to May 2004 (n~=~2750) and the prevalence of travelling to and from school by walking, car and public transport was determined for Grade 6, 8 and 10 students. Results:~ Among Grade 6 students, approximately 30\% travelled by car, 30\% walked and 20\% used public transport to travel to school (the travel habits of 20\% could not be accurately characterised). Among secondary school students, approximately 50\% used public transport, 15--20\% travelled by car and 15--20\% walked. Among those who walked or used public transport, the median times spent walking were 10--15~min and 5~min per trip, respectively. Conclusions:~ While there is little scope to increase the prevalence of active transport among secondary school students, there is potential to do so among primary school students. Primary school students who replace travelling to and from school by car with walking will experience an increase in activity energy expenditure of up to 10\% and those who change to public transport will experience an increase in activity energy expenditure of up to 3\%.},

However, very little is known about NAFLD among young people, particularly from a population perspective. This paper reports the prevalence of elevated concentrations of four liver enzymes and their associations with adiposity in a representative population sample of Australian adolescents. Methods:~ Overnight fasting blood samples were collected from a representative population sample of 500 Grade 10 students (15-years-old) attending schools in Sydney, Australia, between February and May, 2004. Weight, height and waist girth were measured. The prevalence of adverse concentrations of the enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were described for all boys and girls and by body mass index (BMI) categories. The nature of the associations between the enzyme concentrations and indices of adiposity were characterised, and regression equations for estimating enzyme concentrations from BMI were prepared. Results:~ The prevalence of adverse concentrations of ALT (most likely as a result of NAFLD) and GGT were approximately 10\%, while the prevalence of adverse concentrations of AST and ALP were approximately 7\% and 5\% respectively. The prevalence of adverse concentrations of ALT, GGT and AST increased across BMI categories, while the prevalence of adverse concentrations of ALP declined across BMI categories. Conclusions:~ The high prevalence of NAFLD in a population sample of healthy Australian adolescents represents a significant burden of disease.},

The prevalence of adverse concentrations of ALT, GGT and AST increased across BMI categories, while the prevalence of adverse concentrations of ALP declined across BMI categories. Conclusions: The high prevalence of NAFLD in a population sample of healthy Australian adolescents represents a significant burden of disease.}

Whilst the antiviral drug oseltamivir (a neuraminidase inhibitor) is approved for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza during outbreaks, there have been no trials comparing treatment only (T) versus treatment and prophylaxis (T\&P) in Aged Care Facilities (ACFs). Our objective was to compare a policy of T versus T\&P for influenza outbreaks in ACFs. Methods and Findings: We performed a cluster randomised controlled trial in 16 ACFs, that followed a policy of either ``T''---oseltamivir treatment (75 mg twice a day for 5 days)---or ``T\&P''---treatment and prophylaxis (75 mg once a day for 10 days) for influenza outbreaks over three years, in addition to enhanced surveillance. The primary outcome measure was the attack rate of influenza. Secondary outcomes measures were deaths, hospitalisation, pneumonia and adverse events. Laboratory testing was performed to identify the viral cause of influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks. The study period 30 June 2006 to 23 December 2008 included three southern hemisphere winters. During that time, influenza was confirmed as the cause of nine of the 23 ILI outbreaks that occurred amongst the 16 ACFs. The policy of T\&P resulted in a significant reduction in the influenza attack rate amongst residents: 93/255 (36\%) in residents in T facilities versus 91/397 (23\%) in T\&P facilities (p = 0.002). We observed a non-significant reduction in staff: 46/216 (21\%) in T facilities versus 47/350 (13\%) in T\&P facilities (p = 0.5). There was a significant reduction in mean duration of outbreaks (T = 24 days, T\&P = 11 days, p = 0.04). Deaths, hospitalisations and pneumonia were non-significantly reduced in the T\&P allocated facilities. Drug adverse events were common but tolerated. Conclusion: Our trial lacked power but these results provide some support for a policy of ``treatment and prophylaxis'' with oseltamivir in controlling influenza outbreaks in ACFs.

Simulations were used to verify the accuracy of the formula and to improve the approximation for small trials. The sample size calculations are illustrated in a clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis. Results: If the correlation between the outcome measured at baseline and at follow-up is r, ANCOVA comparing groups of (1 {\`A} r2)n subjects has the same power as t-test comparing groups of n subjects.

The authors could not find a validated, reliable tool for measuring regret after health care decisions.Methods.A5- item scale was administered to 4 patient groups making different health care decisions. Convergent validity was deter- mined by examining the scale's correlation with satisfaction measures, decisional conflict, and health outcome measures.Results.The scale showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's = 0.81 to 0.92). It correlated strongly with decision satisfaction (r = -0.40 to -0.60), decisional conflict (r = 0.31 to 0.52), and overall rated quality of life (r = -0.25 to - 0.27). Groups differing on feelings about a decision also differed on rated regret: F(2, 190) = 31.1, P {$<$} 0.001. Regret was greater among those who changed their decisions than those who did not, t(175) = 16.11, P {$<$} 0.001.Conclusions.The scale is a useful indicator of health care decision regret at a given point in time.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Methods: We performed an interrupted time series analysis using Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme claims data (July 2005 to December 2015). We assessed the impact of both policies on monthly quetiapine dispensing (25 mg and {$>$}25 mg) and the impact of policy change 2 on monthly rates of 25-mg discontinuation and switching from 25 mg to other quetiapine strengths. We also estimated the impact of both policies on the proportion of people with potentially inappropriate therapy (no evidence of dose escalation) following 25-mg initiation. Results: Following removal of prior authorisation, 25-mg and {$>$}25-mg quetiapine dispensing in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme 10\% sample increased by 11/month (95\% CI: 2--21) and 14/month (95\% CI: 8--20), respectively. After removing 25-mg repeats, there was a permanent decrease of 1072 (95\% CI 773--1371) dispensings and an increase in discontinuation of this strength; 48\% of people dispensed the 25-mg strength that discontinued, discontinued quetiapine completely; the remainder continued to use higher quetiapine strengths. We observed minimal switching to other quetiapine strengths. There was no change in inappropriate 25-mg therapy following policy change 1 and a small decrease (79\% to 76\%, P = 0.05) following policy change 2. Conclusion: More nuanced policies are needed to ensure the appropriate access to 25-mg quetiapine for dose escalation while discouraging use for indications where the evidence of risk and benefit is unclear.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in annual patterns of psychotropic medication use in Australia from 2007 to 2015. METHODS: We used a 10\% sample of individual-level nationwide dispensing claims for concessional beneficiaries dispensed psychotropic medications (stratified by class, subclass) to investigate annual trends and changes in the incidence and prevalence of use, median annual duration of exposure, proportion of people with single psychotropic dispensing and median defined daily doses per person dispensed each medicine per year. RESULTS: Over the study period, there was a 26.1\% decrease in the incidence and a 2.6\% increase in the prevalence of all psychotropic medicine use. We observed a decrease in the annual incidence and prevalence of antidepressants (11.6\% and 16.8\%, respectively) but increases in the median annual duration of exposure (7.4\%). Amitriptyline had the highest proportion of single dispensings of all antidepressants throughout the study period (26.5\% in 2015) and defined daily doses per person dispensed each medicine per year increased by 20\% for antidepressants overall. Benzodiazepine use decreased across all measures over the study period apart from long-term use (exposure for {$>$}240 days of the year), which in 2015 was 23.6\% of those dispensed a benzodiazepine. We observed a relative increase in the incidence and prevalence of antipsychotic use (14.2\% and 26.8\%, respectively), and haloperidol had the highest proportion of single dispensings of any antipsychotic throughout the study period (47.5\% in 2015). We observed a relative increase in the incidence and prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medication use of 114.0\% and 101.8\%, respectively, over the study period. CONCLUSION: Increasing doses and treatment durations of antidepressants warrants further investigation due to concerns about overuse. Single dispensings of amitriptyline and haloperidol may indicate off-label use and long-term use of benzodiazepines remains problematic. Despite increases in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medication use, prevalence of use is still much lower than the estimated prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in the adult population.},

METHODS: We used pharmaceutical claims from a national 10\% sample of people with complete dispensing histories to estimate the annual prevalence of the combined use (overlap of {$>$}60~days exposure) of {$\geq$}2 psychotropics overall and within the same class or subclass (class and subclass polypharmacy). We also estimated the proportion of polypharmacy episodes involving one, two, three and four or more unique prescribers. RESULTS: The prevalence of class polypharmacy between 2006 and 2015 in people dispensed specific psychotropic classes was 5.9-7.3\% for antipsychotics, 2.1-3.7\% for antidepressants and 4.3-2.9\% for benzodiazepines. The prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy was higher than expected given the prevalence of antipsychotic exposure and combinations of sedating agents were notably common. Overall, 26.7\% of polypharmacy episodes involved multiple prescribers but having multiple prescribers occurred more frequently for class and subclass polypharmacy and people with four or more concomitant psychotropics. DISCUSSION: Psychotropic polypharmacy is common, despite limited evidence of risks and benefits. Increases in polypharmacy with multiple prescribers may be due to poor communication with patients and between health care professionals.},

The erratic behavior of the coverage probability of the standard Wald confidence interval has previously been remarked on in the literature (Blyth and Still, Agresti and Coull, Santner and others). We begin by showing that the chaotic coverage properties of the Wald interval are far more persistent than is appreciated. Furthermore, common textbook prescriptions regarding its safety are misleading and defective in several respects and cannot be trusted. This leads us to consideration of alternative intervals. A number of natural alternatives are presented, each with its motivation and context. Each interval is examined for its coverage probability and its length. Based on this analysis, we recommend the Wilson interval or the equal-tailed Jeffreys prior interval for small n and the interval suggested in Agresti and Coull for larger n. We also provide an additional frequentist justification for use of the Jeffreys interval.}

Participants: First-time OST entrants (August 2001-December 2010). Measurements: Characteristics of clients were examined. Time-dependent Cox models examined factors associated with the risk of leaving first treatment, with demographic, criminographic and treatment variables jointly considered. Interactions between medication and other variables upon risk of leaving treatment were examined. Findings: There were 15600 treatment entrants: 7183 (46\%) commenced buprenorphine, 8417 (54\%) commenced methadone; the proportion entering buprenorphine increased over time. Those starting buprenorphine switched medications more frequently and had more subsequent treatment episodes. Buprenorphine retention was also poorer. On average, 44\% spent 3+ months in treatment compared with 70\% of those commencing methadone; however, buprenorphine retention for first-time entrants improved over time, whereas methadone retention did not. Multivariable Cox models indicated that in addition to sex, age, treatment setting and criminographic variables, the risk of leaving a first treatment episode was greater on any given day for those receiving buprenorphine, and was dependent on the year treatment was initiated. There was no interaction between any demographic variables and medication received, suggesting no clear evidence of any particular groups for whom each medication might be better suited in terms of improving retention. Conclusions: Although retention rates for buprenorphine treatment have improved in New South Wales, Australia, individuals starting methadone treatment still show higher retention rates.}

  abstract = {The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement was developed to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials. It was initially published in 1996 and focused on the reporting of parallel group randomised controlled trials. The statement was revised in 2001, with a further update in 2010. A separate CONSORT statement for the reporting of abstracts was published in 2008. In earlier papers we considered the implications of the 2001 version of the CONSORT statement for the reporting of cluster randomised trial. In this paper we provide updated and extended guidance, based on the 2010 version of the CONSORT statement and the 2008 CONSORT statement for the reporting of abstracts. Many journals now require that reports of trials conform to the guidelines in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, first published in 1996,1 revised in 2001,2 and revised most recently in 2010.3 The statement includes a checklist of items that should be included in the trial report. These items are evidence based whenever possible and are regularly reviewed.4 The statement also recommends including a flow diagram to show the progression of participants from group assignment through to the final analysis. An explanation and elaboration of the rationale for the checklist items is provided in an accompanying article.4 The standard CONSORT statement focuses on reporting parallel group randomised controlled trials in which individual participants are randomly assigned to study groups. However, in some situations it is preferable to randomly assign groups of people (such as communities, families, or medical practices) rather than individuals. Reasons include the threat of ``contamination'' (the unintentional spill-over of intervention effects from one treatment group to another) of some interventions if individual randomisation is used.5 6 Also, in certain settings, randomisation by group may be the only feasible method {\dots}},

  abstract = {Background: Interest in the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to treat chronic non-cancer pain is increasing, because of their potential to reduce opioid dose requirements. We aimed to investigate cannabis use in people living with chronic non-cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, including their reasons for use and perceived effectiveness of cannabis; associations between amount of cannabis use and pain, mental health, and opioid use; the effect of cannabis use on pain severity and interference over time; and potential opioid-sparing effects of cannabis. Methods: The Pain and Opioids IN Treatment study is a prospective, national, observational cohort of people with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed opioids. Participants were recruited through community pharmacies across Australia, completed baseline interviews, and were followed up with phone interviews or self-complete questionnaires yearly for 4 years. Recruitment took place from August 13, 2012, to April 8, 2014. Participants were asked about lifetime and past year chronic pain conditions, duration of chronic non-cancer pain, pain self-efficacy, whether pain was neuropathic, lifetime and past 12-month cannabis use, number of days cannabis was used in the past month, and current depression and generalised anxiety disorder. We also estimated daily oral morphine equivalent doses of opioids. We used logistic regression to investigate cross-sectional associations with frequency of cannabis use, and lagged mixed-effects models to examine temporal associations between cannabis use and outcomes. Findings: 1514 participants completed the baseline interview and were included in the study from Aug 20, 2012, to April 14, 2014. Cannabis use was common, and by 4-year follow-up, 295 (24\%) participants had used cannabis for pain. Interest in using cannabis for pain increased from 364 (33\%) participants (at baseline) to 723 (60\%) participants (at 4 years). At 4-year follow-up, compared with people with no cannabis use, we found that participants who used cannabis had a greater pain severity score (risk ratio 1{$\cdot$}14, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}01--1{$\cdot$}29, for less frequent cannabis use; and 1{$\cdot$}17, 1{$\cdot$}03--1{$\cdot$}32, for daily or near-daily cannabis use), greater pain interference score (1{$\cdot$}21, 1{$\cdot$}09--1{$\cdot$}35; and 1{$\cdot$}14, 1{$\cdot$}03--1{$\cdot$}26), lower pain self-efficacy scores (0{$\cdot$}97, 0{$\cdot$}96--1{$\cdot$}00; and 0{$\cdot$}98, 0{$\cdot$}96--1{$\cdot$}00), and greater generalised anxiety disorder severity scores (1{$\cdot$}07, 1{$\cdot$}03--1{$\cdot$}12; and 1{$\cdot$}10, 1{$\cdot$}06--1{$\cdot$}15). We found no evidence of a temporal relationship between cannabis use and pain severity or pain interference, and no evidence that cannabis use reduced prescribed opioid use or increased rates of opioid discontinuation. Interpretation: Cannabis use was common in people with chronic non-cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, but we found no evidence that cannabis use improved patient outcomes. People who used cannabis had greater pain and lower self-efficacy in managing pain, and there was no evidence that cannabis use reduced pain severity or interference or exerted an opioid-sparing effect. As cannabis use for medicinal purposes increases globally, it is important that large well designed clinical trials, which include people with complex comorbidities, are conducted to determine the efficacy of cannabis for chronic non-cancer pain.

  abstract = {Background: The literature suggests patient characteristics and higher opioid doses and long-term duration are associated with problematic opioid behaviours but no one study has examined the role of all these factors simultaneously in a long-term prospective cohort study. Methods: Five-year, community-based, prospective cohort of people prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Logistic mixed effect models with multiple imputation were used to address missing data. Oral morphine equivalent (OME) mg per day was categorised as: 0 mg OME/day, 1--49 mg OME/day (reference), 50--89 mg OME/day, 90--199 mg OME/day and 200mg+ OME/day. Patient risk factors included: age, gender, substance use, mental health history and pain-related factors. Main outcomes included: Prescribed Opioids Difficulties Scale (PODS), Opioid-Related Behaviours In Treatment (ORBIT) scale, and ICD-10 opioid dependence. Multiple confounders for problematic opioid behaviours were assessed. Findings: Of 1,514 participants 44.4\% were male (95\%CI 41.9--46.9) and their mean age was 58 years (IQR 48--67). Participants had a mean duration of pain of 10 years (IQR 4.5--20.0) and had been taking strong opioids for a median of four years (IQR 1.0--10.0). At baseline, median OME/day was 73 (IQR 35--148). At 5-years, 85\% were still taking strong opioids. PODS moderate-high scores reduced from 59.9\% (95\%CI 58.8--61.0) at baseline to 51.5\% (95\%CI 50.0--53.0) at 5-years. Around 9\% met criteria for ICD-10 opioid dependence at each wave. In adjusted mixed effect models, the risk factors most consistently associated with problematic opioid use were: younger age, substance dependence, mental health histories and higher opioid doses. Interpretation: Both patient risk factors and opioid dose are associated with problematic opioid use behaviours.}

  abstract = {Objectives The objective of this study was to compare performance of logistic regression (LR) with machine learning (ML) for clinical prediction modeling in the literature. Study Design and Setting We conducted a Medline literature search (1/2016 to 8/2017) and extracted comparisons between LR and ML models for binary outcomes. Results We included 71 of 927 studies. The median sample size was 1,250 (range 72--3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5--563) and eight events per predictor (range 0.3--6,697). The most common ML methods were classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. In 48 (68\%) studies, we observed potential bias in the validation procedures. Sixty-four (90\%) studies used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess discrimination. Calibration was not addressed in 56 (79\%) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between an LR and ML model (AUC range, 0.52--0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the difference in logit(AUC) between LR and ML was 0.00 (95\% confidence interval, -0.18 to 0.18). For 137 comparisons at high risk of bias, logit(AUC) was 0.34 (0.20--0.47) higher for ML. Conclusion We found no evidence of superior performance of ML over LR. Improvements in methodology and reporting are needed for studies that compare modeling algorithms.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims: Recent research suggests that parental supply of alcohol is associated with more risky drinking and alcohol-related harm among adolescents. However, the overall effect of parental supply throughout adolescence remains unclear, because parental supply of alcohol varies during adolescence. Due to the complexity of longitudinal data, standard analytical methods can be biased. This study examined the effect of parental supply of alcohol on alcohol-related outcomes in early adulthood using robust methods to minimize risk of bias. Design: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Australia. Participants: A cohort of school students (n = 1906) recruited in the first year of secondary school (average age 12.9 years) from Australian schools in 2010--11, interviewed annually for 7 years. Measurements: The exposure variable was self-reported parental supply of alcohol (including sips/whole drinks) during 5 years of adolescence (waves 1--5). Outcome variables were self-reported binge drinking, alcohol-related harm and symptoms of alcohol use disorder, measured in the two waves after the exposure period (waves 6--7). To reduce risk of bias, we used targeted maximum likelihood estimation to assess the (counterfactual) effect of parental supply of alcohol in all five waves versus no supply on alcohol-related outcomes. Findings: Parental supply of alcohol throughout adolescence saw greater risk of binge drinking [risk ratios (RR) = 1.53; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27--1.84] and alcohol-related harms (RR = 1.44; 95\% CI = 1.22--1.69) in the year following the exposure period compared with no supply in adolescence. Earlier initiation of parental supply also increased risk of binge drinking (RR = 1.10; 95\% CI = 1.05--1.14), and any alcohol-related harm (RR = 1.09; 95\% CI = 1.05--1.13) for each year earlier parental supply began compared with later (or no) initiation. Conclusions: Adolescents whose parents supply them with alcohol appear to have an increased risk of alcohol-related harm compared with adolescents whose parents do not supply them with alcohol. The risk appears to increase with earlier initiation of supply.}

RESULTS: Relevant surgical specialty, urgency rating, employment status and health insurance status were significantly associated with waiting time. Age, hospital, sex, country of birth, education, marital status and holding a Health Care Card were not significantly associated with waiting time. Self-reported health status (as measured by the SF-36) was not associated with waiting time for surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Waiting time for surgery was not simply determined by how urgently patients need surgery, but also by the type of surgery needed and patient's employment and health insurance status.

Quotation from the film Amadeus (1984) As a statistical reviewer for Archives and BMJ I am interested in the presentation of numerical data.1 It concerns me that numbers are often reported to excessive precision, because too many digits can swamp the reader, overcomplicate the story and obscure the message. A number's precision relates to its decimal places or significant figures (or as preferred here, significant digits ). The number of decimal places is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point, while the number of significant digits is the number of all digits ignoring the decimal point, and ignoring all leading zeros and some trailing zeros (for a fuller definition see `significant figures' on Wikipedia). Ideally data should be rounded appropriately, not too much and not too little (one might call it Goldilocks rounding).2 The European Association of Science Editors guidelines include the useful rule of thumb: ``numbers should be given in (sic) 2--3 effective digits''.3 Take as an example the odds ratio (OR) of 22.68 (95\% CI 7.51 to 73.67) comparing beta mimetics with placebo for side effects requiring a change of medication.4 Its two decimal places and four significant digits are excessive when the effect size and confidence interval (CI) are so large. Reporting it rounded to two significant digits, as 23 (7.5 to 74), or even as 23 (8 to 70), with one {\dots}},

  abstract = {Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web based survey and revised during a three day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).

  abstract = {Introduction: Regular screening for risky drinking is important to improve the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. We explored whether the rate of screening for risky drinking using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test---Consumption (AUDIT-C) questions was disrupted at Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS) during state-wide and territory-wide COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. Methods: Retrospective analysis of screening data from 22 ACCHSs located in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. These services provide holistic and culturally appropriate primary care. A multi-level Poisson regression, including AR(1) autocorrelation, was used to predict counts of AUDIT-C screening at ACCHSs. Results: AUDIT-C screening was suppressed during state-wide and territory-wide lockdowns in 2020 (incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.42 [0.29, 0.61]). The effect of lockdowns differed by service remoteness. While there was a substantial reduction in AUDIT-C screening for urban and inner regional services (IRR 0.25 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.15, 0.42]), there was not a statistically significant change in screening at outer regional and remote (IRR 0.60 [95\% CI 0.33, 1.09]) or very remote services (IRR 0.67 [95\% CI 0.40, 1.11]). Discussion and Conclusions: The COVID-19 lockdowns in Australia likely suppressed rates of screening for risky drinking in urban and inner regional regions. As harm from alcohol consumption may have increased during lockdowns, policymakers should consider implementing measures to enable screening for risky drinking to continue during future lockdowns.}

  abstract = {Resilience may be viewed as a measure of stress coping ability and, as such, could be an important target of treatment in anxiety, depression, and stress reactions. We describe a new rating scale to assess resilience. The Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC) comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5-point scale (0--4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. The scale was administered to subjects in the following groups: community sample, primary care outpatients, general psychiatric outpatients, clinical trial of generalized anxiety disorder, and two clinical trials of PTSD. The reliability, validity, and factor analytic structure of the scale were evaluated, and reference scores for study samples were calculated. Sensitivity to treatment effects was examined in subjects from the PTSD clinical trials. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties and factor analysis yielded five factors. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that an increase in CD-RISC score was associated with greater improvement during treatment. Improvement in CD-RISC score was noted in proportion to overall clinical global improvement, with greatest increase noted in subjects with the highest global improvement and deterioration in CD-RISC score in those with minimal or no global improvement. The CD-RISC has sound psychometric properties and distinguishes between those with greater and lesser resilience. The scale demonstrates that resilience is modifiable and can improve with treatment, with greater improvement corresponding to higher levels of global improvement.

We developed hierarchical models accounting for differences between individuals of different experience levels (under- and post-graduate), within experience levels, and between different table-graph pairs. In our experiment, information could be extracted quicker and, for less experienced participants, more accurately from graphical presentations than tabular displays. We also performed a literature review to assess the prevalence of hard-to-interpret design features in tables of simulation studies in three popular statistics journals, finding that many are presented innumerately.

We used multi-dimensional criteria to identify OUD recovery subgroups and longitudinal transitions across subgroups. Design, Setting and Participants In a national longitudinal observational study in the United States, individuals who previously participated in a clinical trial for subcutaneous buprenorphine injections for treatment of OUD were enrolled and followed for an average of 4.2 years after participation in the clinical trial. Measurements We identified recovery subgroups based on psychosocial outcomes including depression, opioid withdrawal and pain. We compared opioid use, treatment utilization and quality of life among these subgroups. Findings Three dimensions of the recovery process were identified: depression, opioid withdrawal and pain. Using these three dimensions, participants were classified into four recovery subgroups: high-functioning (minimal depression, mild withdrawal and no/mild pain), pain/physical health (minimal depression, mild withdrawal and moderate pain), depression (moderate depression, mild withdrawal and mild/moderate pain) and low-functioning (moderate/severe withdrawal, moderate depression and moderate/severe pain). Significant differences among subgroups were observed for DSM-5 criteria (P {$<$} 0.001) and remission status (P {$<$} 0.001), as well as with opioid use (P {$<$} 0.001), treatment utilization (P {$<$} 0.001) and quality of life domains (physical health, psychological, environment and social relationships; Ps {$<$} 0.001, Cohen's fs {$\geq$} 0.62). Recovery subgroup assignments were dynamic, with individuals transitioning across subgroups during the observational period. Moreover, the initial recovery subgroup assignment was minimally predictive of long-term outcomes. Conclusions There appear to be four distinct subgroups among individuals in recovery from OUD. Recovery subgroup assignments are dynamic and predictive of contemporaneous, but not long-term, substance use, substance use treatment utilization or quality of life outcomes.},

  abstract = {Missing data due to loss to follow-up or intercurrent events are unintended, but unfortunately inevitable in clinical trials. Since the true values of missing data are never known, it is necessary to assess the impact of untestable and unavoidable assumptions about any unobserved data in sensitivity analysis. This tutorial provides an overview of controlled multiple imputation (MI) techniques and a practical guide to their use for sensitivity analysis of trials with missing continuous outcome data. These include {$\delta$}- and reference-based MI procedures. In {$\delta$}-based imputation, an offset term, {$\delta$}, is typically added to the expected value of the missing data to assess the impact of unobserved participants having a worse or better response than those observed. Reference-based imputation draws imputed values with some reference to observed data in other groups of the trial, typically in other treatment arms. We illustrate the accessibility of these methods using data from a pediatric eczema trial and a chronic headache trial and provide Stata code to facilitate adoption. We discuss issues surrounding the choice of {$\delta$} in {$\delta$}-based sensitivity analysis. We also review the debate on variance estimation within reference-based analysis and justify the use of Rubin's variance estimator in this setting, since as we further elaborate on within, it provides information anchored inference.},

  abstract = {This presentation discusses the options for including continuous covariates in regression models. In his book, Clinical Prediction Models, Ewout Steyerberg presents a hierarchy of procedures for continuous predictors, starting with dichotomizing the variable and moving to modeling the variable using restricted cubic splines or using a fractional polynomial model. This presentation discusses all of the choices, with a focus on the last two. Restricted cubic splines express the relationship between the continuous covariate and the outcome using a set of cubic polynomials, which are constrained to meet at pre-specified points, called knots. Between the knots, each curve can take on the shape that best describes the data. A fractional polynomial model is another flexible method for modeling a relationship that is possibly nonlinear. In this model, polynomials with noninteger and negative powers are considered, along with the more conventional square and cubic polynomials, and the small subset of powers that best fits the data is selected. The presentation describes and illustrates these methods at an introductory level intended to be useful to anyone who is familiar with regression analyses.},

We aimed to comprehensively assess trends and variation in opioid prescribing in primary care in England, from 1998 to 2018, and to assess factors associated with high-dose opioid prescribing behaviour in general practices.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We did a retrospective database study using open data sources on prescribing for all general practices in England. For all standard opioids we calculated the number of items prescribed, costs, and oral morphine equivalency to account for variation in strength. We assessed long-term prescribing trends from 1998 to 2017, patterns of geographical variation for 2018, and investigated practice factors associated with higher opioid prescribing. We also analysed prescriptions for long-acting opioids at high doses.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between 1998 and 2016, opioid prescriptions increased by 34\% in England (from 568 per 1000 patients to 761 per 1000). After correcting for total oral morphine equivalency, the increase was 127\% (from 190 000 mg to 431 000 mg per 1000 population). There was a decline in prescriptions from 2016 to 2017. If every practice prescribed high-dose opioids at the lowest decile rate, 543 000 fewer high-dose prescriptions could have been issued over a period of 6 months. Larger practice list size, ruralness, and deprivation were associated with greater high-dose prescribing rates. The clinical commissioning group to which a practice belongs accounted for 11{$\cdot$}7\% of the variation in high-dose prescribing. We have developed a publicly available interactive online tool, OpenPrescribing.net, which displays all primary care opioid prescribing data in England down to the individual practice level.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Failing to account for opioid strength would substantially underestimate the true increase in opioid prescribing in the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Our findings support calls for greater action to promote best practice in chronic pain prescribing and to reduce geographical variation. This study provides a model for routine monitoring of opioid prescribing to aid targeting of interventions to reduce high-dose prescribing.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) School of Primary Care Research, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre Oxford, NHS England.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {\# Odds ratios should be used only in case-control studies and logistic regression analyses \{\#article-title-2\} EDITOR---Expressing the results of clinical trials and systematic reviews in terms of odds ratios can be more seriously misleading than Davies et al advise us.1 They gave a correct analysis of situations in which odds ratios are used to describe increases in event rates, but their consideration of the more common situation, in which treatments reduce event rates, is short sighted. Here, effectiveness is more commonly expressed as the percentage relative risk reduction (100=D7(1-relative risk)\%) than the actual relative risk. The discrepancy between a relative risk reduction and the equivalent relative odds reduction (100=D7(1-odds ratio)\%) can be misleading. When event rates are high (commonly the case in trials and systematic reviews) the relative odds reduction can be many times larger than the equivalent relative risk reduction. For example, Brent et al report results of a trial of a programme aimed at increasing the duration of breast feeding.2 By three months 32/51(63\%) women had stopped breast feeding in the intervention group, compared with 52/57(91\%) in the control group. Whereas the relative risk reduction is 31\% the relative odds reduction is 84\%: nearly three times as large. The same problem can occur in systematic reviews: a summary of the results of seven trials of antimicrobial treatment on premature rupture of membranes showed a 49\% relative odds reduction of delivery by seven days, whereas the relative risk reduction was only 19\%.3 Although relative odds and relative risk reductions always go in the same direction, these discrepancies {\dots}},

  abstract = {Objective: To estimate the number of regular and dependent methamphetamine users in Australia. Design: Indirect prevalence estimates were made for each year from 2002--03 to 2013--14. We applied multiplier methods to data on treatment episodes for amphetamines (eg, counselling, rehabilitation, detoxification) and amphetamine-related hospitalisations to estimate the numbers of regular (at least monthly) and dependent methamphetamine users for each year. Dependent users comprised a subgroup of those who used the drug regularly, so that estimates of the sizes of these two populations were not additive. Results: We estimated that during 2013--14 there were 268 000 regular methamphetamine users (95\% CI, 187 000--385 000) and 160 000 dependent users (95\% CI, 110 000--232 000) aged 15--54 years in Australia. This equated to population rates of 2.09\% (95\% CI, 1.45--3.00\%) for regular and 1.24\% (95\% CI, 0.85--1.81\%) for dependent use. The rate of dependent use had increased since 2009--10 (when the rate was estimated to be 0.74\%), and was higher than the previous peak (1.22\% in 2006--07). The highest rates were consistently among those aged 25--34 years, in whom the rate of dependent use during 2012--2013 was estimated to be 1.50\% (95\% CI, 1.05--2.22\%). There had also been an increase in the rate of dependent use among those aged 15--24 years (in 2012--13 reaching 1.14\%; 95\% CI, 0.80--1.69\%). Conclusions: There have been increases over the past 12 years in the numbers of regular and dependent methamphetamine users in Australia. Our estimates suggest that the most recent numbers are the highest for this period, and that the increase has been most marked among young adults (those aged 15--34 years). Implications: There is an increasing need for health services to engage with people who have developed problems related to their methamphetamine use.},

  abstract = {Aims A new oxycodone formulation (Reformulated OxyContin{\textregistered}) was released in Australia, early 2014. It was developed as a tamper-resistant (`abuse-deterrent') formulation of the drug. We summarize methods used in the National Opioid Medication Abuse Deterrence (NOMAD) study, which will examine: (i) whether there is a reduction in extra-medical use (including via tampering) of OxyContin{\textregistered} following the introduction of Reformulated OxyContin{\textregistered}; (ii) potential changes in extra-medical use of non-abuse-deterrent forms of oxycodone, other pharmaceutical opioids and illicit drugs; (iii) whether methods of tampering with Reformulated OxyContin{\textregistered} become widespread over time; (iv) Reformulated OxyContin{\textregistered}'s attractiveness on the illicit market; and (v) sales, prescriptions and harms related to OxyContin{\textregistered} and other drugs. Methods There are three major components. First, analyses of existing routine data sources such as: pharmaceutical sales; prescribing data; data on drug overdose deaths; and survey data on drug use in the general population and among people who inject drugs; secondly, specific data on OxyContin{\textregistered} collected through the Illicit Drug Reporting System; and thirdly, a prospective cohort of n\,=\,606 people who regularly misuse or tamper with pharmaceutical opioids was formed prior to the introduction of Reformulated OxyContin{\textregistered}, followed-up twice post-release to examine potential changes after Reformulated OxyContin{\textregistered}'s introduction. Discussion The study's strengths lie in varied data collections; interrupted time--series analysis; and prospective cohort. To our knowledge, this is one of the most comprehensive and transparently conducted studies conducted to date of the potential impact of an opioid medication upon use, tampering and diversion. Results have the potential to inform policymakers, clinicians, consumers and researchers alike.},

  abstract = {Importance: Despite concern about harms related to long-term prescribed opioid use among individuals with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP), no study has examined whether the same patients engage in a risky pattern of use consistently for the long term. Objective: To examine the prevalence, incidence, persistence, and cessation of a range of opioid behaviors, indicators of extramedical use, and harm among individuals who are prescribed opioids. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 5-year prospective cohort study in communities across Australia included 1514 adults who were prescribed opioids for CNCP. Data collection took place from August 2012 to December 2018, and data analysis took place from February to November 2020. Exposure: Prescription opioid use. Main Outcomes and Measures: High-dose opioid use ({$\geq$}200 oral morphine equivalent [OME] mg/d); requesting an increase in opioid dose; requesting an early prescription renewal; tampering with opioid medication; diversion of medication to others; and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision opioid dependence. Cessation of opioid use was also assessed. Results: Of the 1514 participants, 672 (44.39\%) were men, the mean (SD) age was 58 (19) years, and 737 (48.68\%) were unemployed. At each annual interview, approximately 1 in 8 people (10.98\% [95\% CI, 10.33\%-11.63\%] to 14.73\% [95\% CI, 13.98\%-15.48\%] at any given interview) were taking more than 200 OME mg/d; comparatively more had requested an increased dosage in the previous 3 months (8.46\% [95\% CI, 7.89\%-9.03\%] to 23.77\% [95\% CI, 22.82\%-24.73\%]); and fewer asked for an early prescription renewal (4.61\% [95\% CI, 4.19\%-5.03\%] to 13.97\% [95\% CI, 13.24\%-14.70\%]). In any given interview, between 3.06\% (95\% CI, 2.72\%-3.40\%) and 7.86\% (95\% CI, 7.31\%-8.41\%) of respondents reported tampering and between 0.47\% (95\% CI, 0.33\%-0.60\%) and 1.39\% (95\% CI, 1.16\%-1.62\%) reported diversion to others. Between 8.28\% (95\% CI, 7.71\%-8.84\%) and 13.06\% (95\% CI, 12.35\%-13.77\%) met criteria for opioid dependence at each interview. Opioid cessation increased across interviews, from year 1 (9.15\% [95\% CI, 8.55\%-9.74\%]) to year 5 (20.02\% [19.14\%-20.89\%]). There was considerable incidence and cessation in all behaviors from 1 interview to the next: most who engaged in any of these behaviors only did so at only 1 interview. For pharmaceutical opioid dependence, between 55.26\% (95\% CI, 53.81\%-56.71\%) and 64.44\% (95\% CI, 62.87\%-66.00\%) of cases in 1 interview did not meet dependence criteria in the following interview. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest considerable fluidity in opioid use, extramedical behaviors, and opioid dependence among people with CNCP. This reinforces the need for reassessment of the effectiveness and safety of prescription opioid use over time.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Opioid prescribing is increasing in many countries. In Australia, there is limited research on patterns of prescribing and access, or the outcomes associated with this use. The aim of this research programme is to use national dispensing data to estimate opioid use and costs, including problematic or extramedical use in the Australian population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a cohort of persons dispensed at least one opioid in 2013, we will estimate monthly utilisation and costs of prescribed opioids, overall and according to individual opioid formulations and strengths. In a cohort of new opioid users, commencing therapy between 1 July 2009 and 31 December 2013, we will examine patterns of opioid use including initiation of therapy, duration of treatment and concomitant use of opioids and other prescribed medicines. We will also examine patterns of extramedical opioid use based on indicators including excess dosing, use of more than one opioid concomitantly, doctor/pharmacy shopping and accelerated time to prescription refill. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was approved by the NSW Population and Health Services Ethics Committee (March 2014) and data access approved by the Department of Human Services External Review Evaluation Committee (June 2014). This will be one of the first comprehensive Australian studies with the capability to investigate individual patterns of use and track extramedical use. In the first instance our analysis will be based on 5\>years of dispensing data but will be expanded with ongoing annual data updates. This research has the capability to contribute significantly to pharmaceutical policy within Australia and globally. In particular, the trajectory of extramedical prescription-opioid use has been the subject of limited research to date. The results of this research will be published widely in general medical, pharmacoepidemiology, addiction and psychiatry journals.},

The design was a prospective study of 101 patients with schizophrenia and related disorders who were assessed monthly over 10 months on medication compliance, cannabis and other drug use, symptoms of depression and symptoms of psychosis.Method. Linear regression methods to assess relationships between cannabis use and symptoms of psychosis and depression while adjusting for serial dependence, medication compliance and other demographic and clinical variables.Results. Cannabis use predicted a small but statistically significant increase in symptoms of psychosis, but not depression, after controlling for other differences between cannabis users and non-users. Symptoms of depression and psychosis did not predict cannabis use.Conclusion. Continued cannabis use by persons with schizophrenia predicts a small increase in psychotic symptom severity but not vice versa.},

  abstract = {When comparing two independent groups, psychology researchers commonly use Student's t-tests. Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance underlie this test. More often than not, when these conditions are not met, Student's t-test can be severely biased and lead to invalid statistical inferences. Moreover, we argue that the assumption of equal variances will seldom hold in psychological research, and choosing between Student's t-test and Welch's t-test based on the outcomes of a test of the equality of variances often fails to provide an appropriate answer. We show that the Welch's t-test provides a better control of Type 1 error rates when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not met, and it loses little robustness compared to Student's t-test when the assumptions are met. We argue that Welch's t-test should be used as a default strategy.~Publisher's Note: A correction article relating to this paper has been published and can be found at https://www.rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.661/.},

We conducted a systematic review of studies published between January 2000 and July 2019 to catalogue LTOT definitions, the rationale for definitions and LTOT rates in observational research using routinely collected data in nonsurgical settings. We screened 4056 abstracts, 210 full-text manuscripts and included 128 studies, mostly from the United States (81\%) and published between 2015 and 2019 (69\%). We identified 78 definitions of LTOT, commonly operationalised as 90 days of use within a year (23\%). Studies often used multiple criteria to derive definitions (60\%), mostly based on measures of duration, such as supply days/days of use (66\%), episode length (21\%) or prescription fills within specified time periods (12\%). Definitions were based on previous publications (63\%), clinical judgment (16\%) or empirical data (3\%); 10\% of studies applied more than one definition. LTOT definition was not provided with enough details for replication in 14 studies and 38 studies did not specify the opioids evaluated. Rates of LTOT within study populations ranged from 0.2\% to 57\% according to study design and definition used. We observed a substantial rise in the last 5 years in studies evaluating LTOT with large variability in the definitions used and poor reporting of the rationale and implementation of definitions. This variation impacts on research reproducibility, comparability of findings and the development of strategies aiming to curb therapy that is not guideline-recommended.}

Little is known about cancer therapies used by farm residents. Study type: Data linkage cohort study. Methods: Baseline survey information from the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study cohort was linked with data from the New South Wales Admitted Patient Data Collection for 2006--2012. Adjusted odds of receiving surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or brachytherapy for each cancer were compared between groups, controlling for selected variables. Results: Differences in the likelihood of surgery for breast and colorectal cancer between groups were not significant. However, for prostate cancer, farm men had 35\% greater odds of prostatectomy than rural nonfarm men (odds ratio [OR] 1.35; 95\% CI 1.05, 1.72). Urban men were most likely to have had brachytherapy, with three times greater odds of treatment than farm men (OR 2.90; 95\% CI 1.51, 5.56). Urban women were most likely to have had chemotherapy for breast cancer, having twice the odds of receiving this treatment as farm women (OR 2.24; 95\% CI 1.25, 4.04). The odds of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer among rural nonfarm residents were two-thirds the odds among urban men (OR 0.62; 95\% CI 0.44, 0.90) and urban women (OR 0.57; 95\% CI 0.37, 0.88). Age, distance, income and health insurance factors contributed to differences in nonsurgical care between groups. Conclusions: Cancer-related surgical services for breast and colorectal cancer were comparable between groups. Farm and rural nonfarm residents may have been disadvantaged in relation to nonsurgical therapies for prostate, breast and colorectal cancer compared with urban counterparts.}

  abstract = {Likert questionnaires are widely used in survey research, but it is unclear whether the item data should be investigated by means of parametric or nonparametric procedures. This study compared the Type I and II error rates of the t test versus the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) for five-point Likert items. Fourteen population distributions were defined and pairs of samples were drawn from the populations and submitted to the t test and the t test on ranks, which yields the same results as MWW. The results showed that the two tests had equivalent power for most of the pairs. MWW had a power advantage when one of the samples was drawn from a skewed or peaked distribution. Strong power differences between the t test and MWW occurred when one of the samples was drawn from a multimodal distribution. Notably, the Type I error rate of both methods was never more than 3\% above the nominal rate of 5\%, even not when sample sizes were highly unequal. In conclusion, for five-point Likert items, the t test and MWW generally have similar power, and researchers do not have to worry about finding a difference whilst there is none in the population.Accessed 61,170 times on https://pareonline.net from October 06, 2010 to December 31, 2019.

The present paper discusses the need to include group- or macro-level variables in epidemiologic studies, thus incorporating multiple levels of determination in the study of health outcomes. These types of analyses, which have been called contextual or multi-level analyses, challenge epidemiologists to develop theoretical models of disease causation that extend across levels and explain how group-level and individual-level variables interact in shaping health and disease. They also raise a series of methodological issues, including the need to select the appropriate contextual unit and contextual variables, to correctly specify the individual-level model, and, in some cases, to account for residual correlation between individuals within contexts. Despite its complexities, multilevel analysis holds potential for reemphasizing the role of macro-level variables in shaping health and disease in populations.},

Multilevel analysis has emerged as one analytical strategy that may partly address this need, by allowing the simultaneous examination of group-level and individual-level factors. This paper reviews the rationale for using multilevel analysis in public health research, summarizes the statistical methodology, and highlights some of the research questions that have been addressed using these methods. The advantages and disadvantages of multi level analysis compared with standard methods are reviewed. The use of multilevel analysis raises theoretical and methodological issues related to the theoretical model being tested, the conceptual distinction between group and individual-level variables, the ability to differentiate ``independent'' effects, the reciprocal relationships between factors at different levels, and the increased complexity that these models imply. The potentialities and limitations of multilevel analysis, within the broader context of understanding the role of factors defined at multiple levels in shaping health outcomes, are discussed.},

  abstract = {{\copyright} 2015 Dobbins et al. Background: Comparing outcomes between hospitals requires consideration of patient factors that could account for any observed differences. Adjusting for comorbid conditions is common when studying outcomes following cancer surgery, and a commonly used measure is the Charlson comorbidity index. Other measures of patient health include the ECOG performance status and the ASA physical status score. This study aimed to ascertain how frequently ECOG and ASA scores are recorded in population-based administrative data collections in New South Wales, Australia and to assess the contribution each makes in addition to the Charlson comorbidity index in risk adjustment models for comparative assessment of colorectal cancer surgery outcomes between hospitals. Methods: We used linked administrative data to identify 6964 patients receiving surgery for colorectal cancer in 2007 and 2008. We summarised the frequency of missing data for Charlson comorbidity index, ECOG and ASA scores, and compared patient characteristics between those with and without these measures. The performance of ASA and ECOG in risk adjustment models that also included Charlson index was assessed for three binary outcomes: 12-month mortality, extended length of stay and 28-day readmission. Patient outcomes were compared between hospital peer groups using multilevel logistic regression analysis. Results: The Charlson comorbidity index could be derived for all patients, ASA score was recorded for 78 \% of patients and ECOG performance status recorded for only 24 \% of eligible patients. Including ASA or ECOG improved the predictive ability of models, but there was no consistently best combination. The addition of ASA or ECOG did not substantially change parameter estimates for hospital peer group after adjusting for Charlson comorbidity index. Conclusions: While predictive ability of regression models is maximised by inclusion of one or both of ASA score and ECOG performance status, there is little to be gained by adding ASA or ECOG to models containing the Charlson comorbidity index to address confounding. The Charlson comorbidity index has good performance and is an appropriate measure to use in risk adjustment to compare outcomes between hospitals.}

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to investigate the uptake of laparoscopically assisted resection for colon and rectal cancer and to compare short- and long-term outcomes using population data. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study using linked administrative health data. SETTINGS: The study encompassed all of the public and private hospitals in NSW, Australia, between 2000 and 2008. PATIENTS: A total of 27,947 patients with colon or rectal cancer undergoing surgery with curative intent were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We summarized the proportion of resections performed laparoscopically. Short-term outcomes were extended stay, 28-day readmission, 28-day emergency readmission, 30- and 90- day mortality, and 90-day readmission with pulmonary embolism or deep-vein thrombosis. Long-term outcomes were all-cause and cancer-specific death and admission with obstruction or incisional hernia repair. RESULTS: Laparoscopic procedures increased between 2000 and 2008 for colon (1.5\%20.7\%) and rectal cancer (0.6\%15.5\%). Laparoscopic procedures reduced rates of extended stay (OR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.490.72) and 28-day readmission (OR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.740.99) for colon cancer. For rectal cancer, laparoscopic procedures had lower rates of 28-day readmission (OR, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.420.78) and 28-day emergency readmission (OR, 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.340.85). Laparoscopic procedures improved cancer-specific survival for rectal cancer (HR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.511.00). Survival benefits were observed for laparoscopically assisted colon resection in highercaseload hospitals but not lower-caseload hospitals. LIMITATIONS: It was not possible to identify laparoscopically assisted resections converted to open procedures because of the claims-based nature of the data. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increases in laparoscopically assisted resections for colon and rectal cancer, the majority of resections are still treated by open procedures. Our data suggest that laparoscopic resection reduces the lengths of stay and rates of readmission and may result in improved cancer-specific survival for both colon and rectal resections. {\copyright} The ASCRS 2014.}

  abstract = {Workplace health promotion initiatives have proliferated, but there are difficulties in recruiting employees of lower socioeconomic status and at higher risk of disease. A survey of health behaviors and attitudes was administered in 20 worksites and the opportunity to attend a health risk assessment promoted. Those more likely to attend were women, those of higher occupational prestige, and those from a non-English-speaking background. After adjustment for these variables, the only health behavior associated with attendance was smoking status. Perceived risk of lung cancer was significant, even after adjustment for smoking status.

A resulting consequence is that researchers conducting such trials are faced with a multitude of design choices, including selection of the primary unit of inference, the degree to which clusters should be matched or stratified by prognostic factors at baseline, and decisions related to cluster subsampling. Moreover, application of ethical principles developed for individually randomized trials may also require modification., We discuss several topics related to these issues, with emphasis on the choices that must be made in the planning stages of a trial and on some potential pitfalls to be avoided.},

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In ``The Future of Data Analysis,'' he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or ``data analysis.'' Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name ``data science'' for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of ``data science'' programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M ``Data Science Initiative'' that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as ``cultural appropriation.'' This article reviews some ingredients of the current ``data science moment,'' including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for ``scaling up'' to ``big data.'' This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere ``scaling up,'' but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are ``learning from data,'' and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today's data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals. Based on a presentation at the Tukey Centennial Workshop, Princeton, NJ, September 18, 2015.},

Using a cross-sectional sample from an observational cohort study conducted from August 2018 to March 2020, we examined the extent to which PrEP-experienced GBM are willing to have CLAI with a partner who has a UVL. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify associated variables. Of the 1386 participants included in the analyses, 79.0\% believed in the effectiveness of TasP, and 55.3\% were willing to have CLAI with a partner who has a UVL. Wiling participants were less worried about getting HIV when taking PrEP and more likely to believe in TasP. Further research is needed to better understand the gap between belief in TasP and willingness to have CLAI with a partner who has a UVL among PrEP-experienced GBM.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$}}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: External cause International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are commonly used to ascertain adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to hospitalisation. We quantified ascertainment of ADR-related hospitalisation using external cause codes and additional ICD-based hospital diagnosis codes. METHODS: We reviewed the scientific literature to identify different ICD-based criteria for ADR-related hospitalisations, developed algorithms to capture ADRs based on candidate hospital ICD-10 diagnoses and external cause codes (Y40-Y59), and incorporated previously published causality ratings estimating the probability that a specific diagnosis was ADR related. We applied the algorithms to the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection records of 45 and Up Study participants (2011-2013). RESULTS: Of 493 442 hospitalisations among 267 153 study participants during 2011-2013, 18.8\% (n = 92 953) had hospital diagnosis codes that were potentially ADR related; 1.1\% (n = 5305) had high/very high-probability ADR-related diagnosis codes (causality ratings: A1 and A2); and 2.0\% (n = 10 039) had ADR-related external cause codes. Overall, 2.2\% (n = 11 082) of cases were classified as including an ADR-based hospitalisation on either external cause codes or high/very high-probability ADR-related diagnosis codes. Hence, adding high/very high-probability ADR-related hospitalisation codes to standard external cause codes alone (Y40-Y59) increased the number of hospitalisations classified as having an ADR-related diagnosis by 10.4\%. Only 6.7\% of cases with high-probability ADR-related mental symptoms were captured by external cause codes. CONCLUSION: Selective use of high-probability ADR-related hospital diagnosis codes in addition to external cause codes yielded a modest increase in hospitalised ADR incidence, which is of potential clinical significance. Clinically validated combinations of diagnosis codes could potentially further enhance capture.},

Design: Serial cross-sectional study with weekly telephone surveys (April 2006-May 2013). Interrupted time-series analyses using ARIMA modelling and linear regression models were used to investigate intervention effects. Participants: 15 745 adult smokers (aged 18 years and above) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.

Outcomes: Salience of tobacco pack health warnings, cognitive and emotional responses to warnings, avoidance of warnings, perceptions regarding one's cigarette pack. Results: Adjusting for background trends, seasonality, antismoking advertising activity and cigarette costliness, results from ARIMA modelling showed that, 2-3 months after the introduction of the new packs, there was a significant increase in the absolute proportion of smokers having strong cognitive (9.8\% increase, p=0.005), emotional (8.6\% increase, p=0.01) and avoidant (9.8\% increase, p=0.0005) responses to on-pack health warnings. Similarly, there was a significant increase in the proportion of smokers strongly disagreeing that the look of their cigarette pack is attractive (57.5\% increase, p{$<$}0.0001), says something good about them (54.5\% increase, p{$<$}0.0001), influences the brand they buy (40.6\% increase, p{$<$}0.0001), makes their pack stand out (55.6\% increase, p{$<$}0.0001), is fashionable (44.7\% increase, p{$<$}0.0001) and matches their style (48.1\% increase, p{$<$}0.0001).

  abstract = {Background: We have previously shown that service-wide support can increase the odds of alcohol screening in any 2-month period in a cluster randomized trial of service-wide support to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS). Here we report an exploratory analysis on whether the resulting pattern of screening was appropriate. Aim: we assess whether that increase in screening was associated with: (i) increased first-time screening, (ii) increased annual screening, (iii) whether frequently screened clients fell into one of four risk categories as defined by national guidelines. Methods: Setting and participants: 22 ACCHS; randomized to receive the support model in the treatment (`early-support') arm over 24-months or to the waitlist control arm. Intervention: eight-component support, including training, sharing of experience, audit-and-feedback and resource support. Analysis: records of clients with visits before and after start of implementation were included. Multilevel logistic modelling was used to compare (i) the odds of previously unscreened clients receiving an AUDIT-C screen, (ii) odds of clients being screened with AUDIT-C at least once annually. We describe the characteristics of a sub-cohort of clients who received four or more screens annually, including if they were in a high-risk category. Results: Of the original trial sample, 43,054 met inclusion criteria, accounting for 81.7\% of the screening events in the overall trial. The support did not significantly increase the odds of first-time screening (OR = 1.33, 95\% CI 0.81--2.18, p = 0.25) or of annual screening (OR = 0.99, 95\% CI 0.42--2.37, p = 0.98). Screening more than once annually occurred in 6240 clients. Of the 841 clients with four or more screens annually, over 50\% did not fall into a high-risk category. Females were overrepresented. More males than females fell into high-risk categories. Conclusion: The significant increase in odds of screening observed in the main trial did not translate to significant improvement in first-time or annual screening following implementation of support. This appeared to be due to some clients being screened more frequently than annually, while more than half remained unscreened. Further strategies to improve alcohol screening should focus on appropriate screening regularity as well as overall rates, to ensure clinically useful information about alcohol consumption.

  abstract = {Background and aims: There is a higher prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use among Indigenous populations, but there have been few studies of the effectiveness of screening and treatment in primary health care. Over 24 months, we tested whether a model of service-wide support could increase screening and any alcohol treatment. Design: Cluster-randomized trial with 24-month implementation (12 months active, 12 months maintenance). Setting: Australian Aboriginal Community Controlled primary care services. Participants: Twenty-two services (83 032 clients) that use Communicare practice software and see at least 1000 clients annually, randomized to the treatment arm or control arm. Intervention and comparator: Multi-faceted early support model versus a comparator of waiting-list control (11 services). Measurements: A record (presence = 1, absence = 0) of: (i) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test---Consumption (AUDIT-C) screening (primary outcome), (ii) any-treatment and (iii) brief intervention. We received routinely collected practice data bimonthly over 3 years (1-year baseline, 1-year implementation, 1-year maintenance). Multi-level logistic modelling was used to compare the odds of each outcome before and after implementation. Findings: The odds of being screened within any 2-month reference period increased in both arms post-implementation, but the increase was nearly eight times greater in early-support services [odds ratio (OR) = 7.95, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 4.04--15.63, P {$<$} 0.001]. The change in odds of any treatment in early support was nearly double that of waiting-list controls (OR = 1.89, 95\% CI = 1.19--2.98, P = 0.01) but was largely driven by decrease in controls. There was no clear evidence of difference between groups in the change in the odds of provision of brief intervention (OR = 1.95, 95\% CI = 0.53--7.17, P = 0.32). Conclusions: An early support model designed to aid routine implementation of alcohol screening and treatment in Aboriginal health services resulted in improvement of Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test---Consumption screening rates over 24 months of implementation, but the effect on treatment was less clear.}

This review aimed to systematically assess the evidence of the effect of family-based therapy programs on child maltreatment outcomes. CINAHL, Scopus and PsycINFO were systematically searched to March 25, 2023. Outcome data were extracted for child protection reports and out-of-home care (OOHC) placements from administrative data, and parent- or child-reported maltreatment risk. 12 RCTs and two observational studies of 8,410 screened were included. All 14 studies had high risk of bias. Sample sizes ranged from 43 in an RCT to 3875 families in an observational study. In seven studies with child protection report risk estimates, five studies (3 RCTs, 2 observational) showed results in favor of the intervention (risk differences (RD) of 2.0--41.1 percentage points) and two RCTs in favor of the comparison (RD, 2.0--8.6 percentage points). In the four studies with OOHC risk estimates, three studies (2 RCTs, 1 observational) showed results in favor of the intervention (RD, 0.9--17.4 percentage points) and one observational study showed results in favor of the comparison (RD, 1.5 percentage points). Most studies had {$\leq$} 100 participants, did not estimate main causal effects, and had high risk of bias. Thus, although family-based therapy programs may reduce child maltreatment, the high risk of bias, typically small sample sizes ({$>$} 62\% of studies had sample sizes {$<$} 100), and inconsistent results across studies means it is currently unclear whether family-based therapy interventions achieve better child maltreatment outcomes, compared with usual care services.}

Frequently, the two parts are a model for the binary response variable and a model for the outcome variable that is conditioned on the binary response. Two common examples are zero-inflated or hurdle models for count data and two-part models for semicontinuous data. Recently, there has been particular interest in the use of these models for the analysis of repeated measures of an outcome variable over time. The aim of this review is to consider motivations for the use of such models in this context and to highlight the central issues that arise with their use. We examine two-part models for semicontinuous and zero-heavy count data, and we also consider models for count data with a two-part random effects distribution.},

However, when the response vari*able is discrete, these residuals are distributed far from normality and have nearly parallel curves according to the distinct discrete response values, imposing great challenges for visual inspection.},

  abstract = {The relative risk, risk difference, and odds ratio are three major indices of differences in risks of diseases between different groups. Although widely used in research and practice in biomedical and epidemiologic research, misconceptions are not uncommon about their relationships. Many publications offer contradicting advices in how to use them in studies. Some biomedical researchers believe that these indices are related in a monotone fashion, and, thus, changes in one direction in one of the indices can be interpreted as same directional changes in the other two. Misconceptions about these three indices such as the monotone relationship are so prevalent in the biomedical and epidemiologic research that clarifications of such popular beliefs are warranted. In this paper, we take a systematic approach to characterize the relationships among the indices. We develop key results to elucidate the intricate relationships between the indices. Our findings speak to the need for investigators to carefully consider the different indices before using them in their studies, since they are not interchangeable and results based on one index are generally not translatable into any of the others.},

In the Fall 2017 semester, we implemented GitHub Classroom in two educational settings---an introductory computational statistics lab and a more advanced computational statistics course. We found many educational benefits of implementing GitHub Classroom, such as easily providing coding feedback during assignments and making students more confident in their ability to collaborate and use version control tools for future data science work. To encourage and ease the transition into using GitHub Classroom, we provide free and publicly available resources---both for students to begin using Git/GitHub and for teachers to use GitHub Classroom for their own courses.},

One such SCCS study, based on all COVID-19 cases arising in Sweden over an 8-month period, has shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risks of AMI and ischemic stroke. Some features of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, present in this study and likely in others, complicate the analysis and may introduce bias.

  abstract = {Nonrandomized studies of treatments from electronic healthcare databases are critical for producing the evidence necessary to making informed treatment decisions, but often rely on comparing rates of events observed in a small number of patients. In addition, studies constructed from electronic healthcare databases, for example, administrative claims data, often adjust for many, possibly hundreds, of potential confounders. Despite the importance of maximizing efficiency when there are many confounders and few observed outcome events, there has been relatively little research on the relative performance of different propensity score methods in this context. In this paper, we compare a wide variety of propensity-based estimators of the marginal relative risk. In contrast to prior research that has focused on specific statistical methods in isolation of other analytic choices, we instead consider a method to be defined by the complete multistep process from propensity score modeling to final treatment effect estimation. Propensity score model estimation methods considered include ordinary logistic regression, Bayesian logistic regression, lasso, and boosted regression trees. Methods for utilizing the propensity score include pair matching, full matching, decile strata, fine strata, regression adjustment using one or two nonlinear splines, inverse propensity weighting, and matching weights. We evaluate methods via a `plasmode' simulation study, which creates simulated datasets on the basis of a real cohort study of two treatments constructed from administrative claims data. Our results suggest that regression adjustment and matching weights, regardless of the propensity score model estimation method, provide lower bias and mean squared error in the context of rare binary outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether the addition of immunosuppression to supportive care offers benefit in resource poor Asian district hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a randomised placebo-controlled trial comparing immunosuppression (intravenous cyclophosphamide up to 1\,g/day for two days and methylprednisolone 1\,g/day for three days, and then oral dexamethasone 8\,mg three-times-a-day for 14 days) with saline and placebo tablets, in addition to standard care, in patients with acute paraquat self-poisoning admitted to six Sri Lankan hospitals between 1st March 2007 and 15th November 2010. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 299 patients were randomised to receive immunosuppression (147) or saline/placebo (152). There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality rates between the groups (immunosuppression 78 [53\%] vs. placebo 94 [62\%] (Chi squared test 2.4, p\,=\,.12). There was no difference in mortality at three months between the immunosuppression (101/147 [69\%]) and placebo groups (108/152 [71\%]); (mortality reduction 2\%, 95\% CI: -8 to +12\%). A Cox model did not support benefit from high-dose immunosuppression but suggested potential benefit from the subsequent two weeks of dexamethasone.

Objectives: We aimed to determine whether the addition of immunosuppression to supportive care offers benefit in resource poor Asian district hospitals.

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: 299 patients were randomised to receive immunosuppression (147) or saline/placebo (152). There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality rates between the groups (immunosuppression 78 [53\%] vs. placebo 94 [62\%] (Chi squared test 2.4, p =.12). There was no difference in mortality at three months between the immunosuppression (101/147 [69\%]) and placebo groups (108/152 [71\%]); (mortality reduction 2\%, 95\% CI: -8 to +12\%). A Cox model did not support benefit from high-dose immunosuppression but suggested potential benefit from the subsequent two weeks of dexamethasone.

Resolving this paradox requires stronger statistical leadership to guide multidisciplinary teams in the design and planning of scientific research and making decisions based on data. It requires more effective communication to nonstatisticians of the value of statistics in using data to answer questions, predict outcomes, and support decision-making in the face of uncertainty. It also requires a greater appreciation of the unique capabilities of alternative quantitative disciplines such as machine learning, data science, pharmacometrics, and bioinformatics which represent an opportunity for statisticians to achieve greater impact through collaborative partnership. Examples taken from pharmaceutical drug development are used to illustrate the concept of statistical leadership in a collaborative multidisciplinary team environment.},

  abstract = {Purpose The POPPY II cohort is an Australian state-based cohort linking data for a population of individuals prescribed opioid medicines, constructed to allow a robust examination of the long-term patterns and outcomes of prescription opioid use. Participants The cohort includes 3 569 433 adult New South Wales residents who initiated a subsidised prescription opioid medicine between 2003 and 2018, identified through pharmacy dispensing data (Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) and linked to 10 national and state datasets and registries including rich sociodemographic and medical services data. Findings to date Of the 3.57 million individuals included in the cohort, 52.7\% were female and 1 in 4 people were aged {$\geq$}65 years at the time of cohort entry. Approximately 6\% had evidence of cancer in the year prior to cohort entry. In the 3 months prior to cohort entry, 26.9\% used a non-opioid analgesic and 20.5\% used a psychotropic medicine. Overall, 1 in 5 individuals were initiated on a strong opioid (20.9\%). The most commonly initiated opioid was paracetamol/codeine (61.3\%), followed by oxycodone (16.3\%). Future plans The POPPY II cohort will be updated periodically, both extending the follow-up duration of the existing cohort, and including new individuals initiating opioids. The POPPY II cohort will allow a range of aspects of opioid utilisation to be studied, including long-term trajectories of opioid use, development of a data-informed method to assess time-varying opioid exposure, and a range of outcomes including mortality, transition to opioid dependence, suicide and falls. The duration of the study period will allow examination of population-level impacts of changes to opioid monitoring and access, while the size of the cohort will also allow examination of important subpopulations such as people with cancer, musculoskeletal conditions or opioid use disorder.}

This cohort will be linked to a wide range of other datasets containing information on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, health service use and adverse outcomes (eg, opioid dependence and non-fatal and fatal overdose). Analyses will initially examine patterns and predictors of prescribed opioid use and then apply regression and survival analysis to quantify the risks and risk factors of adverse outcomes associated with prescribed opioid use. Ethics and dissemination This study has received full ethical approval from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Ethics Committee, the NSW Population and Health Services Research Committee and the ACT Health Human Research Ethics Committee. This will be the largest postmarketing surveillance study of prescribed opioids undertaken in Australia, linking exposure and outcomes and examining risk factors for adverse outcomes of prescribed opioids. As such, this work has important translational promise, with direct relevance to regulatory authorities and agencies worldwide. Project findings will be disseminated at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. We will also conduct targeted dissemination with policy makers, professional bodies and peak bodies in the pain, medicine and addiction fields through stakeholder workshops and advisory groups.

  abstract = {Background: Evidence on the effectiveness of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) in reducing crime is mixed. We aimed to assess the effect of OAT on crime in terms of delaying time to first charge and reducing overall charge rates, as well as the relationship between OAT retention and overall charge rates. Methods: We did a retrospective cohort study of opioid-dependent people who entered OAT for the first time between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 30, 2010, in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We used three linked NSW and national administrative datasets. Data on OAT were obtained from the Pharmaceutical Drugs of Addiction System, data on charges were obtained from the Reoffending Database, and data on mortality were obtained from the National Death Index. The cohort was followed up until Dec 31, 2011. Time-dependent OAT exposure was modelled using Cox proportional hazards models (time to first charge) and Andersen-Gill intensity models (total charge-days). Retention in OAT was modelled using two features of treatment engagement, number of OAT episodes and proportion of follow-up time in OAT (presented in quartile groupings: lowest, low-mid, low-high, highest) using zero-inflated negative binomial regression (total charges). All models were adjusted for sociodemographic, criminographic, and treatment-related variables. Findings: 10 744 new OAT entrants were included in the study. 5751 (53{$\cdot$}5\%) people were charged with an offence. In adjusted analyses, OAT was associated with an initial benefit in delaying the time to first charge (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}43, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}33--0{$\cdot$}55) and reducing total charge-days (0{$\cdot$}39, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}30--0{$\cdot$}52); however, these protective effects reduced over time. Total charge rates were higher as the number of OAT episodes increased (incident rate ratio [IRR] 1{$\cdot$}13, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}11--1{$\cdot$}15), and when relatively lower proportions of time were spent in OAT (IRR among the lowest three quartiles ranged from 1{$\cdot$}11 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}02--1{$\cdot$}21] to 1{$\cdot$}22 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}12--1{$\cdot$}33]). Interpretation: OAT was associated with a reduction in overall charge rates and was more protective as treatment engagement increased. Maximising treatment retention is crucial to achieving long-term health and social benefits of OAT.

  abstract = {Summary Background Evidence on the effectiveness of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) in reducing crime is mixed. We aimed to assess the effect of OAT on crime in terms of delaying time to first charge and reducing overall charge rates, as well as the relationship between OAT retention and overall charge rates. Methods We did a retrospective cohort study of opioid-dependent people who entered OAT for the first time between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 30, 2010, in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We used three linked NSW and national administrative datasets. Data on OAT were obtained from the Pharmaceutical Drugs of Addiction System, data on charges were obtained from the Reoffending Database, and data on mortality were obtained from the National Death Index. The cohort was followed up until Dec 31, 2011. Time-dependent OAT exposure was modelled using Cox proportional hazards models (time to first charge) and Andersen-Gill intensity models (total charge-days). Retention in OAT was modelled using two features of treatment engagement, number of OAT episodes and proportion of follow-up time in OAT (presented in quartile groupings: lowest, low-mid, low-high, highest) using zero-inflated negative binomial regression (total charges). All models were adjusted for sociodemographic, criminographic, and treatment-related variables. Findings 10\hphantom{,}744 new OAT entrants were included in the study. 5751 (53{$\cdot$}5\%) people were charged with an offence. In adjusted analyses, OAT was associated with an initial benefit in delaying the time to first charge (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}43, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}33--0{$\cdot$}55) and reducing total charge-days (0{$\cdot$}39, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}30--0{$\cdot$}52); however, these protective effects reduced over time. Total charge rates were higher as the number of OAT episodes increased (incident rate ratio [IRR] 1{$\cdot$}13, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}11--1{$\cdot$}15), and when relatively lower proportions of time were spent in OAT (IRR among the lowest three quartiles ranged from 1{$\cdot$}11 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}02--1{$\cdot$}21] to 1{$\cdot$}22 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}12--1{$\cdot$}33]). Interpretation OAT was associated with a reduction in overall charge rates and was more protective as treatment engagement increased. Maximising treatment retention is crucial to achieving long-term health and social benefits of OAT.

  abstract = {Importance: There are known risks of using opioids for extended periods. However, less is known about the long-term trajectories of opioid use following initiation. Objective: To identify 5-year trajectories of prescription opioid use, and to examine the characteristics of each trajectory group. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study conducted in New South Wales, Australia, linked national pharmaceutical claims data to 10 national and state data sets to determine sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, drug use, and health services use. The cohort included adult residents (aged {$\geq$}18 years) of New South Wales who initiated a prescription opioid between July 1, 2003, and December 31, 2018. Statistical analyses were conducted from February to September 2022. Exposure: Dispensing of a prescription opioid, with no evidence of opioid dispensing in the preceding 365 days, identified from pharmaceutical claims data. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was the trajectories of monthly opioid use over 60 months from opioid initiation. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to classify these trajectories. Linked health care data sets were used to examine characteristics of individuals in different trajectory groups. Results: Among 3474490 individuals who initiated a prescription opioid (1831230 females [52.7\%]; mean [SD] age, 49.7 [19.3] years), 5 trajectories of long-term opioid use were identified: very low use (75.4\%), low use (16.6\%), moderate decreasing to low use (2.6\%), low increasing to moderate use (2.6\%), and sustained use (2.8\%). Compared with individuals in the very low use trajectory group, those in the sustained use trajectory group were older (age {$\geq$}65 years: 22.0\% vs 58.4\%); had more comorbidities, including cancer (4.1\% vs 22.2\%); had increased health services contact, including hospital admissions (36.9\% vs 51.6\%); had higher use of psychotropic (16.4\% vs 42.4\%) and other analgesic drugs (22.9\% vs 47.3\%) prior to opioid initiation, and were initiated on stronger opioids (20.0\% vs 50.2\%). Conclusions and relevance: Results of this cohort study suggest that most individuals commencing treatment with prescription opioids had relatively low and time-limited exposure to opioids over a 5-year period. The small proportion of individuals with sustained or increasing use was older with more comorbidities and use of psychotropic and other analgesic drugs, likely reflecting a higher prevalence of pain and treatment needs in these individuals..}

Methods: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dispensing records were extracted for a 10\% sample of people who initiated a strong opioid treatment episode (buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone) between 29 September 2009 and 31 December 2013, as evidenced by the absence of a strong opioid dispensing for at least 90 days. The cohort was restricted to people with complete medicines ascertainment. Socio-demographic characteristics, previous dispensing histories and index opioid use were examined. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the factors associated with the type of opioid medicine initiated, relative to oxycodone. Results: The cohort consisted of 125 335 people: 58.3\% were female and 63.7\% were aged {$\geq$}65 years. The most commonly initiated strong opioid was oxycodone (72.8\%), usually 5 mg immediate-release tablets (76.1\%). Compared to people aged 18--44 years, those {$\geq$}85 years were 14.18 times as likely (95\% CI 12.67--15.87) to initiate morphine than oxycodone. Compared to people without a cancer treatment history, those with a cancer treatment history were 2.34 times as likely (95\% CI 2.11--2.60) to initiate morphine than oxycodone. Conclusions: The most commonly initiated strong opioid was oxycodone, usually at lower strengths. Those who initiated oxycodone were more likely to be younger with no previous cancer treatment history. As these are high-risk characteristics for potential harms, a judicious approach when initiating strong opioids for this group is necessary.}

Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the extent to which pharmaceutical claims from Australia's national medicines subsidy programs (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme [PBS] and Repatriation Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits [RPBS]) under-estimate prescription-only and total national opioid utilisation across time and for different opioids. A secondary aim was to examine the impact of the 2012 policy change to record all PBS/RPBS dispensed medicines, irrespective of government subsidy, on the degree of under-estimation. Methods: Aggregated data on Australian opioid utilisation were obtained for the 2010 to 2014 calendar years, including all single ingredient and combination opioid analgesic preparations available on prescription or over-the-counter (OTC). Total opioid utilisation (oral morphine equivalent kilogrammes) was quantified using sales data from IMS Health and compared with pharmaceutical claims data from the PBS/RPBS. Results: PBS/RPBS claims data did not account for 12.4\% of prescription-only opioid utilisation in 2014 and 19.1\% in 2010, and 18.4\% to 25.4\% of total opioid use when accounting for OTC preparations.

Conclusions: Despite increased capture of less expensive (under co-payment) opioid items since 2012, PBS/RPBS claims still under-estimate opioid use in Australia, with varying degrees across opioids. The estimates generated in this study allow us to better understand the degree of under-estimation and account for these in research using Australia's national pharmaceutical claims data.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In February 2012, a reformulated tamper-deterrent form of long-acting oxycodone, OxyNeo, was introduced in Canada. We investigated the impact of the introduction of OxyNeo on patterns of opioid prescribing. METHODS: We conducted population-based, cross-sectional analyses of opioid dispensing in Canada between 2008 and 2016. We estimated monthly community pharmacy dispensing of oral formulations of codeine, morphine, hydromorphone and oxycodone, and a transdermal formulation of fentanyl, and converted quantities to milligrams of morphine equivalents (MMEs) per 1000 population. We used time series analysis to evaluate the effect of the introduction of OxyNeo on these trends. RESULTS: National dispensing of long-acting opioids fell by 14.9\% between February 2012 and April 2016, from 36\,098 MMEs to 30\,716 MMEs per 1000 population (p{$<$} 0.01). This effect varied across Canada and was largest in Ontario (reduction of 22.8\%) (p= 0.01) and British Columbia (reduction of 30.0\%) (p= 0.01). The national rate of oxycodone dispensing fell by 46.4\% after the introduction of OxyNeo (p{$<$} 0.001); this was partially offset by an increase of 47.8\% in hydromorphone dispensing (p{$<$} 0.001). Although dispensing of immediate-release opioids was a substantial contributor to overall population opioid exposure across Canada, it was unaffected by the introduction of OxyNeo (p{$>$} 0.05 in all provinces). INTERPRETATION: The findings suggest that the introduction of a tamper-deterrent formulation of long-acting oxycodone in Canada, against a background of changing public drug benefits, was associated with sustained changes in selection of long-acting opioids but only small changes in the quantity of long-acting opioids dispensed. This illustrates the limited effect a tamper-deterrent formulation and associated coverage policy can have when other, non-tamper-deterrent alternatives are readily available.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since 2010, tamper-resistant long-acting oxycodone has been available in both the United States and Canada; however, generic non-tamper-resistant brands of the drug have only been introduced in Canada. We aimed to determine whether the introduction of generic non-tamper-resistant oxycodone in Canada led to increased sales from Canadian pharmacies near the Canada-US border. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of trends in dispensing of long-acting oxycodone from Canadian community pharmacies in geographic areas contiguous with the Canada-US border between Feb. 1, 2012, and Jan. 31, 2014. We reported the monthly dispensing rates of long-acting oxycodone by province and within each region near the Canada-US border. RESULTS: During the study period, 8~507~882 long-acting oxycodone tablets were dispensed by Canadian pharmacies in regions near Canada-US border crossings. After the introduction of generic non-tamper-resistant formulations in December 2012, the dispensing rate declined in the border regions of Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, and rose slightly in Manitoba (4.4\%) and New Brunswick (3.6\%). Dispensing rates rose by 45.5\% in Alberta and 92.3\% in Saskatchewan; however, only 3341 of the tablets dispensed were a generic non-tamper-resistant formulation. An examination of the dispensing patterns in 50 border areas after the marketing of non-tamper-resistant brands in Canada showed no patterns suggestive of trafficking. INTERPRETATION: We found no large increases in the dispensing rates of generic non-tamper-resistant long-acting oxycodone in Canadian pharmacies near Canada-US border crossings such as were seen after the withdrawal of OxyContin in the United States in 2010. Despite our findings, Canadian clinicians and pharmacists should remain cautious in their prescribing and dispensing of non-tamper-resistant formulations of oxycodone because of their high potential for misuse and abuse.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study investigated the impact of changing availability of tamper-deterrent and non-tamper-deterrent oxycodone on prescribing patterns of controlled-release oxycodone across Canada. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, serial cross-sectional study of controlled-release oxycodone dispensing from community pharmacies across Canada between October 2007 and April 2016. We calculated rates of dispensing (tablets per 100 population) and reported the relative market share of generic non-tamper-deterrent controlled-release oxycodone. All analyses were reported nationally and stratified by province. RESULTS: After the introduction of a tamper-deterrent formulation, the national rate of controlled-release oxycodone dispensing fell by 44.6\% (from 26.4 to 14.6 tablets per 100 population from February 2012 to April 2016). Between December 2012 and July 2013, there was moderate uptake of generic non-tamper-deterrent controlled-release oxycodone (968~452 tablets; 16.0\% in July 2013), which appeared to have little impact on the overall rate of controlled-release oxycodone dispensing in Canada. However, the uptake of generic non-tamper-deterrent oxycodone varied considerably by province. By April 2016, 55.0\% of all controlled-release oxycodone tablets dispensed in Quebec were for the generic formulation. Elsewhere in Canada, this prevalence was less than 30\%, ranging between 1.6\% (Prince Edward Island) and 26.9\% (British Columbia) at the end of our study period. CONCLUSIONS: The changing availability of tamper-deterrent and non-tamper-deterrent formulations of controlled-release oxycodone in Canada has had variable influence on the rate of use of these products across Canada. Future research should explore whether the availability of generic controlled-release oxycodone has led to measurable changes in the safety of oxycodone use in Canada.},

Studies have used datasets sampled from patients admitted to hospital, people tested for active infection, or people who volunteered to participate. Here, we highlight the challenge of interpreting observational evidence from such non-representative samples. Collider bias can induce associations between two or more variables which affect the likelihood of an individual being sampled, distorting associations between these variables in the sample. Analysing UK Biobank data, compared to the wider cohort the participants tested for COVID-19 were highly selected for a range of genetic, behavioural, cardiovascular, demographic, and anthropometric traits. We discuss the mechanisms inducing these problems, and approaches that could help mitigate them. While collider bias should be explored in existing studies, the optimal way to mitigate the problem is to use appropriate sampling strategies at the study design stage.},

In addition, multilevel models have become a standard tool for analyzing the nested data structures that result when lower level units (e.g., employees) are nested within higher level collectives (e.g., work groups). When applying MI to multilevel data, it is important that the imputation model takes the multilevel structure into account. In the present paper, based on theoretical arguments and computer simulations, we provide guidance using MI in the context of several classes of multilevel models, including models with random intercepts, random slopes, cross-level interactions (CLIs), and missing data in categorical and group-level variables. Our findings suggest that, oftentimes, several approaches to MI provide an effective treatment of missing data in multilevel research. Yet we also note that the current implementations of MI still have room for improvement when handling missing data in explanatory variables in models with random slopes and CLIs. We identify areas for future research and provide recommendations for research practice along with a number of step-by-step examples for the statistical software R.},

In this article, we provide an introduction to MI of multilevel missing data using the R package pan, and we discuss its possibilities and limitations in accommodating typical questions in multilevel research. To make pan more accessible to applied researchers, we make use of the mitml package, which provides a user-friendly interface to the pan package and several tools for managing and analyzing multiply imputed data sets.

  abstract = {Analysis of a large longitudinal study of children motivated our work. The results illustrate how accurate inference for fixed effects in a general linear mixed model depends on the covariance model selected for the data. Simulation studies have revealed biased inference for the fixed effects with an underspecified covariance structure, at least in small samples. One underspecification common for longitudinal data assumes a simple random intercept and conditional independence of the within-subject errors (i.e., compound symmetry). We prove that the underspecification creates bias in both small and large samples, indicating that recruiting more participants will not alleviate inflation of the Type I error rate associated with fixed effect inference. Enumerations and simulations help quantify the bias and evaluate strategies for avoiding it. When practical, backwards selection of the covariance model, starting with an unstructured pattern, provides the best protection. Tutorial papers can guide the reader in minimizing the chances of falling into the often spurious software trap of nonconvergence. In some cases, the logic of the study design and the scientific context may support a structured pattern, such as an autoregressive structure. The sandwich estimator provides a valid alternative in sufficiently large samples. Authors reporting mixed-model analyses should note possible biases in fixed effects inference because of the following: (i) the covariance model selection process; (ii) the specific covariance model chosen; or (iii) the test approximation.

  abstract = {AIM: To describe the epidemiology of small screen recreation (SSR) that is: television, computer, video, and DVD use among school students aged 11-15 years in New South Wales, Australia. METHODS: Cross-sectional representative population survey (n=2750) of 45 primary and 48 secondary schools in rural and urban areas. Self-reported time spent in SSR was categorised according to national guidelines into less than 2 h per day (low users) or 2 or more hours per day (high users). RESULTS: Of primary and secondary school students, 53\% and 72\%, respectively, were high users of SSR. Boys spent significantly more time in SSR and were more likely to be high users of SSR compared with girls. For primary students, rural boys had a higher prevalence of high SSR use than urban boys (odds ratio (OR) 1.9, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.5), while overweight girls had a higher prevalence than healthy-weight girls (OR 1.8, 95\% CI 1.2-2.8). For secondary students, rural boys had a lower prevalence of high SSR use than urban boys (OR 0.5, 95\% CI 0.3-0.6), and girls from high SES backgrounds had a lower prevalence than girls from low socio-economic status backgrounds (OR 0.6, 95\% CI 0.3-1.0). CONCLUSION: The majority of school students in New South Wales exceed the national guidelines for SSR. Reducing the time spent in SSR among young people is one potential approach to increasing energy expenditure and reducing adiposity or maintaining a healthy weight. First steps for intervention strategies among school-age children to reduce SSR could include teaching awareness skills and self-monitoring techniques.},

METHODS: Repeat cross-sectional school survey, conducted in 1997 and 2004. School students were randomly selected from grades 8 and 10 in New South Wales Australia (1997, N = 2026; 2004 N = 1771). Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was assessed by self-reported participation in organized and nonorganized physical activity separately for summer and winter by sex, grade, and socioeconomic status (SES). RESULTS: Between survey periods, the proportion of students reporting {$>$} or = 60 min.d(-1) of MVPA increased, except among grade 10 boys during winter. MVPA (min.d(-1)) increased among all groups during summer school terms, during winter school terms, MVPA was relatively stable between surveys for grade 8 students but inconsistent among grade 10 students. Organized MVPA increased among all groups in both summer (19-49 min.d(-1)) and winter (7-21 min.d(-1)) school terms. Participation in nonorganized MVPA increased only during summer school terms (4-32 min.d(-1)) and decreased during winter school terms (7-17 min.d(-1)). MVPA increased consistently among students in the high-SES group compared with other SES groups, independent of season, and in some cases MVPA decreased in low-SES groups during winter school terms. CONCLUSION: Overall, the patterns of change were similar for boys and girls, with substantial increases in summer school terms and insubstantial changes during winter school terms (with the exception of a decrease among grade 10 boys). There was a direct association between change in participation in MVPA and SES, indicating that interventions are required to focus on the needs of less-advantaged students.},

Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was assessed by self-reported participation in organized and nonorganized physical activity separately for summer and winter by sex, grade, and socioeconomic status (SES). Results: Between survey periods, the proportion of students reporting {$>$}= 60 min.d (-) (1) of MVPA increased, except among grade 10 boys during winter. MVPA (min.d (- 1)) increased among all groups during summer school terms, During winter school terms, MVPA was relatively stable between surveys for grade 8 students but inconsistent among grade 10 students. Organized MVPA increased among all groups in both summer (19 - 49 min.d (- 1)) and winter (7 - 21 min.d (- 1)) school terms. Participation in nonorganized MVPA increased only during summer school terms (4 - 32 min.d (- 1)) and decreased during winter school terms (7 - 17 min.d (- 1)). MVPA increased consistently among students in the high-SES group compared with other SES groups, independent of season, and in some cases MVPA decreased in low-SES groups during winter school terms. Conclusion: Overall, the patterns of change were similar for boys and girls, with substantial increases in summer school terms and insubstantial changes during winter school terms (with the exception of a decrease among grade 10 boys). There was a direct association between change in participation in MVPA and SES, indicating that interventions are required to focus on the needs of less-advantaged students.}

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between sedentary activities, including small-screen recreation (SSR: watching TV/DVDs/videos, recreational computer use) and cardiorespiratory endurance (CRE) in children aged 11--15 years. Methods A cross-sectional representative population survey was taken of New South Wales (Australia) school students in Grades 6, 8, and 10 (N=2750) in 2004. Sedentary activities and SSR were measured by a self-report questionnaire. CRE was determined by the 20-meter multi-stage shuttle run test. The optimal cut point for time spent on SSR was determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results Time spent in sedentary activities was inversely associated with CRE among Grade 8 students (p=0.01) and Grade 10 girls (p=0.03). CRE was lower among Grade 8 students (p\&lt;0.001) and Grade 10 girls (p\&lt;0.001) who spent {$\geq$}2 hours/day on SSR compared with students who spent \&lt;2 hours/day. The 2-hour/day cut point for SSR had high sensitivity (boys: 84\%, [95\% CI=79\%, 87\%]; girls: 79\% [95\% CI=74\%, 84\%]) and low specificity (boys: 28\% [95\% CI=24\%, 32\%]; girls: 42\% [95\% CI=38\%, 46\%]). Conclusions Cardiorespiratory endurance did not differ consistently across quintiles of sedentariness and SSR among boys; however, among girls there was a consistent inverse association. If confirmed in prospective studies, these findings have important implications for risk of chronic disease.},

Method: Cross-sectional representative population survey of school students (n=2,750) in New South Wales, conducted in 2004. Students' self-reported time spent during a usual week in five categories of sedentary behaviour (small screen recreation [SSR], education, cultural, social and non-active travel). Height and weight were measured. Results: Grade 6, 8 and 10 students spent approximately 34 hours, 41 hours and 45 hours/week of their discretionary time, respectively, engaged in sedentary behaviour. Urban students and students from Asian-speaking backgrounds spent significantly more time sedentary than students from rural areas or other cultural backgrounds. SSR accounted for 60\% and 54\% of sedentary behaviour among primary and high school students, respectively. Overweight and obese students spent more time in SSR than healthy weight students. Out-of-school hours educational activities accounted for approximately 20\% of sedentary behaviour and increased with age. Girls spent twice the time in social activities compared with boys. Time spent in cultural activities declined with age. Conclusion: Sedentary behaviours among young people differ according to sex, age and cultural background. At least half of all time spent in sedentary behaviours was spent engaged in SSR. BMI was significantly associated with sedentary behaviour among some children, but not consistently across age groups.

We undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy in addition to standard treatment in metastatic breast cancer patients.

Results: Eight trials comprising 1848 patients were eligible for inclusion. HER2-targeted agents were trastuzumab and lapatinib and therapeutic partners were taxanes (4 RCTs), anthracyclines (1), capecitabine (2), anastrozole (1) and letrozole (1).

Yet no currently available instruments have been designed and validated for assessing clinicians' experiences. This research sought to address this important gap by developing and validating a novel instrument in a public health system in Australia. Methods: A multi-method project was conducted using co-design with 12 clinician leaders from a range of NSW Health Local Health Districts to develop the Clinician Experience Measure (CEM). Validity and reliability analyses were conducted in two stages, first assessing face and content validity with a pool of 25 clinicians and then using psychometric analysis with data from 433 clinicians, including nurses, doctors and allied health and representing all districts within one jurisdiction in Australia. Results: Data gathered from 25 clinicians via the face and content validity process indicated that the initial 31-items were relevant to the range of staff employed in the NSW state health system, with minor edits made to the survey layout and wording within two items. Psychometric analysis led to a rationalised 18-item final instrument, comprising four domains: psychological safety (4-items); quality of care (5-items); clinician engagement (4-items) and interprofessional collaboration (5-items). The 18-item four-factor model produced a good fit to the data and high levels of reliability, with factor loadings ranging from.62 to.94, with Cronbach's alpha (range:.83 to.96) and composite reliability (range:.85 to.97). Conclusions: The CEM is an instrument to capture clinicians' experiences of providing care across a health system. The CEM provides a useful tool for healthcare leaders and policy makers to benchmark and assess the impact of value-based care initiatives and direct change efforts.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Approximately 14\% of Australian women smoke during pregnancy. Although the risk of adverse outcomes is reduced by smoking cessation, less than 35\% of Australian women quit smoking spontaneously during pregnancy. Evidence for the efficacy of bupropion, varenicline or nicotine replacement therapy as smoking cessation aids in the non-pregnant population suggest that pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is worth exploring in women of childbearing age. Currently, little is known about the utilisation, effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation during pregnancy; neither the extent to which they are used prior to pregnancy nor whether their use has changed in response to related policy reforms. The Smoking MUMS (Maternal Use of Medications and Safety) Study will explore these issues using linked person-level data for a population-based cohort of Australian mothers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The cohort will be assembled by linking administrative health records for all women who gave birth in New South Wales or Western Australia since 2003 and their children, including records relating to childbirth, use of pharmaceuticals, hospital admissions, emergency department presentations and deaths. These longitudinal linked data will be used to identify utilisation of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies during and between pregnancies and to explore the associated smoking cessation rates and maternal and child health outcomes. Subgroup and temporal analyses will identify potential differences between population groups including indigenous mothers and social security recipients and track changes associated with policy reforms that have made alternative smoking cessation pharmacotherapies available. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained for this study. To enhance the translation of the project's findings into policy and practice, policy and clinical stakeholders will be engaged through a reference group and a policy forum will be held. Outputs from the project will include scientific papers and summary reports designed for policy audiences.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study examined the impact of antismoking activities targeting the general population and an advertising campaign targeting smoking during pregnancy on the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. METHODS: Monthly prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was calculated using linked health records for all pregnancies resulting in a birth (800 619) in NSW from 2003 to 2011. Segmented regression of interrupted time series data assessed the effects of the extension of the ban on smoking in enclosed public places to include licensed premises (evaluated in combination with the mandating of graphic warnings on cigarette packs), television advertisements targeting smoking in the general population, print and online magazine advertisements targeting smoking during pregnancy and increased tobacco tax. Analyses were conducted for all pregnancies, and for the population stratified by maternal age, parity and socioeconomic status. Further analyses adjusted for the effect of the Baby Bonus maternity payment. RESULTS: Prevalence of smoking during pregnancy decreased from 2003 to 2011 overall (0.39\% per month), and for all strata examined. For pregnancies overall, none of the evaluated initiatives was associated with a change in the trend of smoking during pregnancy. Significant changes associated with increased tobacco tax and the extension of the smoking ban (in combination with graphic warnings) were found in some strata. CONCLUSIONS: The declining prevalence of smoking during pregnancy between 2003 and 2011, while encouraging, does not appear to be directly related to general population antismoking activities or a pregnancy-specific campaign undertaken in this period.},

  abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10--30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.},

A Bayesian approach allows the calibration of p-values by transforming them to direct measures of the evidence against the null hypothesis, so-called Bayes factors. We review the available literature in this area and consider two-sided significance tests for a point null hypothesis in more detail. We distinguish simple from local alternative hypotheses and contrast traditional Bayes factors based on the data with Bayes factors based on p-values or test statistics. A well-known finding is that the minimum Bayes factor, the smallest possible Bayes factor within a certain class of alternative hypotheses, provides less evidence against the null hypothesis than the corresponding p-value might suggest. It is less known that the relationship between p-values and minimum Bayes factors also depends on the sample size and on the dimension of the parameter of interest. We illustrate the transformation of p-values to minimum Bayes factors with two examples from clinical research.},

Study Design and Setting We summarize design effects for the SW-CRT, the parallel cluster randomized trial (CRT), and the parallel cluster randomized trial with before and after observations (CRT-BA), assuming cross-sectional samples are selected over time. We present new formulas that enable trialists to determine the required cluster size for a given number of clusters. We illustrate by example how to implement the presented design effects and give practical guidance on the design of stepped wedge studies. Results For a fixed total cluster size, the choice of study design that provides the greatest power depends on the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and the cluster size. When the ICC is small, the CRT tends to be more efficient; when the ICC is large, the SW-CRT tends to be more efficient and can serve as an alternative design when the CRT is an infeasible design. Conclusion Our unified approach allows trialists to easily compare the efficiencies of three competing designs to inform the decision about the most efficient design in a given scenario.},

  abstract = {Stepped-wedge cluster randomised trials (SW-CRTs) are being used with increasing frequency in health service evaluation. Conventionally, these studies are cross-sectional in design with equally spaced steps, with an equal number of clusters randomised at each step and data collected at each and every step. Here we introduce several variations on this design and consider implications for power.One modification we consider is the incomplete cross-sectional SW-CRT, where the number of clusters varies at each step or where at some steps, for example, implementation or transition periods, data are not collected. We show that the parallel CRT with staggered but balanced randomisation can be considered a special case of the incomplete SW-CRT. As too can the parallel CRT with baseline measures. And we extend these designs to allow for multiple layers of clustering, for example, wards within a hospital. Building on results for complete designs, power and detectable difference are derived using a Wald test and obtaining the variance--covariance matrix of the treatment effect assuming a generalised linear mixed model. These variations are illustrated by several real examples.We recommend that whilst the impact of transition periods on power is likely to be small, where they are a feature of the design they should be incorporated. We also show examples in which the power of a SW-CRT increases as the intra-cluster correlation (ICC) increases and demonstrate that the impact of the ICC is likely to be smaller in a SW-CRT compared with a parallel CRT, especially where there are multiple levels of clustering. Finally, through this unified framework, the efficiency of the SW-CRT and the parallel CRT can be compared. {\copyright} 2014 The Authors.

Although the simulations found that the zero-inflated Poisson likelihood performed the best overall, the negative binomial likelihood gave the best fit for both outcomes in the real dataset. Our results suggest that registration to a Family Medicine Group for all 3\,years caused a small reduction in the number of emergency room visits and no significant change in the number of hospitalizations in the final year.},

  abstract = {Cochrane Reviews have recently started including the quantity I 2 to help readers assess the consistency of the results of studies in meta-analyses. What does this new quantity mean, and why is assessment of heterogeneity so important to clinical practice?  Systematic reviews and meta-analyses can provide convincing and reliable evidence relevant to many aspects of medicine and health care.1 Their value is especially clear when the results of the studies they include show clinically important effects of similar magnitude. However, the conclusions are less clear when the included studies have differing results. In an attempt to establish whether studies are consistent, reports of meta-analyses commonly present a statistical test of heterogeneity. The test seeks to determine whether there are genuine differences underlying the results of the studies (heterogeneity), or whether the variation in findings is compatible with chance alone (homogeneity). However, the test is susceptible to the number of trials included in the meta-analysis. We have developed a new quantity, I 2, which we believe gives a better measure of the consistency between trials in a meta-analysis. Assessment of the consistency of effects across studies is an essential part of meta-analysis. Unless we know how consistent the results of studies are, we cannot determine the generalisability of the findings of the meta-analysis. Indeed, several hierarchical systems for grading evidence state that the results of studies must be consistent or homogeneous to obtain the highest grading.2--4 Tests for heterogeneity are commonly used to decide on methods for combining studies and for concluding consistency or inconsistency of findings.5 6 But what does the test achieve in practice, and how should the resulting P values be interpreted? A test for heterogeneity examines the null hypothesis that all studies are evaluating the same effect. The usual test statistic {\dots}},

We utilized one such recently developed approach, MIRA (methylated-CpG island recovery assay) combined with CpG island arrays to identify novel genes that are epigenetically inactivated in breast cancer. Results: Using this approach we identified numerous CpG islands that demonstrated aberrant DNA methylation in breast cancer cell lines. Using a combination of COBRA and sequencing of bisulphite modified DNA, we confirmed 5 novel genes frequently methylated in breast tumours; EMILIN2, SALL1, DBC1, FBLN2 and CIDE-A. Methylation frequencies ranged from between 25\% and 63\% in primary breast tumours, whilst matched normal breast tissue DNA was either unmethylated or demonstrated a much lower frequency of methylation compared to malignant breast tissue DNA. Furthermore expression of the above 5 genes was shown to be restored following treatment with a demethylating agent in methylated breast cancer cell lines. We have expanded this analysis across three other common epithelial cancers (lung, colorectal, prostate). We demonstrate that the above genes show varying levels of methylation in these cancers. Lastly and most importantly methylation of EMILIN2 was associated with poorer clinical outcome in breast cancer and was strongly associated with estrogen receptor as well as progesterone receptor positive breast cancers. Conclusion: The combination of the MIRA assay with CpG island arrays is a very useful technique for identifying epigenetically inactivated genes in cancer genomes and can provide molecular markers for early cancer diagnosis, prognosis and epigenetic therapy.}

  abstract = {The main features of Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) are pre- and postnatal growth restriction and a characteristic small, triangular face. SRS is also accompanied by other dysmorphic features including fifth finger clinodactyly and skeletal asymmetry. The disorder is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and various modes of inheritance and abnormalities involving chromosomes 7, 8, 15, 17, and 18 have been associated with SRS and SRS-like cases. However, only chromosomes 7 and 17 have been consistently implicated in patients with a strict clinical diagnosis of SRS. Two cases of balanced translocations with breakpoints in 17q23.3-q25 and two cases with a hemizygous deletion of the chorionic somatomammatropin gene (CSH1) on 17q24.1 have been associated with SRS, strongly implicating this region. Maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 7 (mUPD(7)) occurs in up to 10\% of SRS patients, with disruption of genomic imprinting underlying the disease status in these cases. Recently, two SRS patients with a maternal duplication of 7p11.2-p13, and a single proband with segmental mUPD for the region 7q31-qter, were described. These key patients define two separate candidate regions for SRS on both the p and q arms of chromosome 7. Both the 7p11.2-p13 and 7q31-qter regions are subject to genomic imprinting and the homologous regions in the mouse are associated with imprinted growth phenotypes. This review provides an overview of the genetics of SRS, and focuses on the newly defined candidate regions on chromosome 7. The analyses of imprinted candidate genes within 7p11.2-p13 and 7q31-qter, and gene candidates on distal 17q, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study examines the prognostic significance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in relation to human papillomavirus (HPV) status in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Materials and methods Pathological diagnosis of 270 oropharyngeal SCCs was verified by the study pathologist; clinical details were extracted from institutional databases. Recurrence in any form or death from any cause was recorded for a median of 2.5 (range: 0--19.3) years after diagnosis. HPV status was determined by HPV E6-targeted multiplex real-time PCR/p16 immunohistochemistry; EGFR expression was evaluated by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry. Determinants of recurrence and mortality hazards were modelled using Cox regression with censoring at dates of last follow-up. Results Thirty-seven percent of cancers were HPV-positive (91\% type 16). HPV was a predictor of loco-regional recurrence, event-free and overall survival after adjustment for clinicopathological variables and EGFR. Patients with EGFR-positive cancers were 5-fold more likely to have loco-regional failure relative to those with EGFR-negative cancers. Patients with HPV-negative/EGFR-positive cancers had an adjusted 13-fold increased risk of having a loco-regional failure, an almost 4-fold increased risk of having an event and more than a 4-fold increased risk of dying of any cause relative to those with HPV-positive/EGFR-negative cancers. There was weak evidence that the effects of EGFR on outcome were limited to patients with HPV-negative cancers. Conclusions HPV and EGFR are independent prognostic markers in oropharyngeal SCC. Combining testing for HPV and EGFR appears to provide additional prognostic information.},

Materials and methods: Pathological diagnosis of 270 oropharyngeal SCCs was verified by the study pathologist; clinical details were extracted from institutional databases. Recurrence in any form or death from any cause was recorded for a median of 2.5 (range: 0-19.3) years after diagnosis. HPV status was determined by HPV E6-targeted multiplex real-time PCR/p16 immunohistochemistry; EGFR expression was evaluated by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry. Determinants of recurrence and mortality hazards were modelled using Cox regression with censoring at dates of last follow-up. Results: Thirty-seven percent of cancers were HPV-positive (91\% type 16). HPV was a predictor of loco-regional recurrence, event-free and overall survival after adjustment for clinicopathological variables and EGFR. Patients with EGFR-positive cancers were 5-fold more likely to have loco-regional failure relative to those with EGFR-negative cancers. Patients with HPV-negative/EGFR-positive cancers had an adjusted 13-fold increased risk of having a loco-regional failure, an almost 4-fold increased risk of having an event and more than a 4-fold increased risk of dying of any cause relative to those with HPV-positive/EGFR-negative cancers. There was weak evidence that the effects of EGFR on outcome were limited to patients with HPV-negative cancers. Conclusions: HPV and EGFR are independent prognostic markers in oropharyngeal SCC. Combining testing for HPV and EGFR appears to provide additional prognostic information. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

PFRdopp may thus have a potential role in the assessment of the pulmonary microcirculation in vivo.},

  abstract = {Background The pulmonary microcirculation is the chief regulatory site for resistance in the pulmonary circuit. Despite pulmonary microvascular dysfunction being implicated in the pathogenesis of several pulmonary vascular conditions, there are currently no techniques for the specific assessment of pulmonary microvascular integrity in humans. Peak hyperemic flow assessment using thermodilution-derived mean transit-time (Tmn) facilitate accurate coronary microcirculatory evaluation, but remain unvalidated in the lung circulation. Using a high primate model, we aimed to explore the use of Tmn as a surrogate of pulmonary blood flow for the purpose of measuring the novel indices Pulmonary Flow Reserve [PFR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}(maximum hyperemic)/(basal flow)] and Pulmonary Index of Microcirculatory Resistance [PIMR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}(maximum hyperemic distal pulmonary artery pressure){\texttimes}(maximum hyperemic Tmn)]. Ultimately, we aimed to investigate the effect of progressive pulmonary microvascular obstruction on PFR and PIMR. Methods and Results Temperature- and pressure-sensor guidewires (TPSG) were placed in segmental pulmonary arteries (SPA) of 13 baboons and intravascular temperature measured. Tmn and hemodynamics were recorded at rest and following intra-SPA administration of the vasodilator agents adenosine (10--400 {\textmu}g/kg/min) and papaverine (3--24 mg). Temperature did not vary with intra-SPA sensor position (0.010{\textpm}0.009 v 0.010{\textpm}0.009{$^\circ$}C; distal v proximal; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.1), supporting Tmn use in lung for the purpose of hemodynamic indices derivation. Adenosine (to 200 {\textmu}g/kg/min) \& papaverine (to 24 mg) induced dose-dependent flow augmentations (40{\textpm}7\% \& 35{\textpm}13\% Tmn reductions v baseline, respectively; p{$<$}0.0001).

  abstract = {Fifty years after Bradford Hill published his extremely influential criteria to offer some guides for separating causation from association, we have accumulated millions of papers and extensive data on observational research that depends on epidemiologic methods and principles. This allows us to re-examine the accumulated empirical evidence for the nine criteria, and to re-approach epidemiology through the lens of exposure-wide approaches. The lecture discusses the evolution of these exposure-wide approaches and tries to use the evidence from meta-epidemiologic assessments to reassess each of the nine criteria and whether they work well as guides for causation. I argue that of the nine criteria, experiment remains important and consistency (replication) is also very essential. Temporality also makes sense, but it is often difficult to document. Of the other six criteria, strength mostly does not work and may even have to be inversed: small and even tiny effects are more plausible than large effects; when large effects are seen, they are mostly transient and almost always represent biases and errors. There is little evidence for specificity in causation in nature. Biological gradient is often unclear how it should it modeled and thus difficult to prove. Coherence remains usually unclear how to operationalize. Finally, plausibility as well as analogy do not work well in most fields of investigation, and their invocation has been mostly detrimental, although exceptions may exist.

We describe what meta-analysis is, what heterogeneity is, and how it affects meta-analysis, effect size, the modeling techniques of meta-analysis, and strengths and weaknesses of meta-analysis. Common components like forest plot interpretation, software that may be used, special cases for meta-analysis, such as subgroup analysis, individual patient data, and meta-regression, and a discussion of criticisms, are included.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To present preliminary outcomes of pulsed dose rate brachytherapy (PDR-BT), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and hormonal manipulation, for prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1999 and January 2005, 165 consecutive patients with Stage T1-T3, N0, M0 prostate cancer were treated. Hormones were used in every patient. Median follow-up was 36 months. Risk groups were low (either Stage {$<$} or =T2a, +/- Gleason score {$<$} or =6, +/- Prostate-Specific Antigen [PSA] level {$<$} or =10 ng/mL); intermediate (either Stage T2b,c, +/- Gleason score 7, +/- PSA 10-20 ng/mL); and high (either Stage T3, +/- Gleason score 8-10, +/- PSA {$>$}20 ng/mL). RESULTS: At 3 years, Radiotherapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Grade 3 and 4 genito-urinary toxicity was 4\% and 1.4\%; RTOG Grade 3 and 4 gastro-intestinal toxicity was 2.6\% and 0\%, respectively. Erectile preservation was 61\%. Overall survival was 93\% (154 of 165) and cause-specific survival was 98\% (162 of 165). At 3 years, disease free survival (DFS) was 93\% (153 of 165). DFS for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups was 100\%, 97\%, and 81\%, respectively (chi(2) (2) = 16.02, p = 0.0003). The nadir plus 2 ng/mL definition (chi(2) (2) = 14.49, p = 0.0007) best predicted clinical failure, having the lowest false-positive rate (3 of 165). The nadir plus 2 ng/mL PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) rate was 100\%, 95\%, and 87\% for the low-, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively. Overall ASTRO PSA-PFS rate was 88\%. CONCLUSIONS: Pulsed dose rate brachytherapy plus EBRT is effective in treating localized prostate cancer, with acceptable toxicity. However, a median 5-year PSA-PFS follow-up is required before providing a solid recommendation. This preliminary information supports continued use.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Classic statistical and machine learning models such as support vector machines (SVMs) can be used to predict cancer outcome, but often only perform well if all the input variables are known, which is unlikely in the medical domain. Bayesian network (BN) models have a natural ability to reason under uncertainty and might handle missing data better. In this study, the authors hypothesize that a BN model can predict two-year survival in non-small cell lungcancer(NSCLC) patients as accurately as SVM, but will predict survival more accurately when data are missing. Methods: A BN and SVM model were trained on 322 inoperable NSCLC patients treated with radiotherapy from Maastricht and validated in three independent data sets of 35, 47, and 33 patients from Ghent, Leuven, and Toronto. Missing variables occurred in the data set with only 37, 28, and 24 patients having a complete data set. Results: The BN model structure and parameter learning identified gross tumor volume size, performance status, and number of positive lymph nodes on a PET as prognostic factors for two-year survival. When validated in the full validation set of Ghent, Leuven, and Toronto, the BN model had an AUC of 0.77, 0.72, and 0.70, respectively. A SVM model based on the same variables had an overall worse performance (AUC 0.71, 0.68, and 0.69) especially in the Ghent set, which had the highest percentage of missing the important GTV size data. When only patients with complete data sets were considered, the BN and SVM model performed more alike. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, the hypothesis is supported that BN models are better at handling missing data than SVM models and are therefore more suitable for the medical domain. Future works have to focus on improving the BN performance by including more patients, more variables, and more diversity.},

Secondary outcomes included seven-day point-prevalence, time to the first cigarette and the daily number of cigarettes smoked after release. Findings From April 2017 to March 2018, a total of 557 participants were randomised to receive the MI (n = 266) or UC (n = 291), with 75\% and 77\% being followed up, respectively.

  abstract = {Background: There are critical periods of mortality risk at onset and cessation of opioid agonist treatment. We aim to determine whether non-fatal overdose followed the same pattern as fatal overdose, comparing the first 4 weeks of treatment and treatment cessation and the remainder time off treatment, with the remainder treatment time, to determine intervention markers. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of people with a history of opioid agonist treatment using linked New South Wales data. The incidence of non-fatal overdose hospitalization; emergency department presentation; and fatal overdose from national death records were compared. Rates were calculated using generalized estimating equations adjusting for demographics, year, and recent health and incarceration events. Results: The remainder time in OAT had the lowest incidence of overdose for all outcomes and is the reference level for the adjusted incident rate ratios (aIRR). Fatal overdose was lowest in treatment and highest in the first four weeks out of treatment, aIRR of 12.83 (95\% CI 10.0--16.4). Whereas the highest overdose rate for non-fatal opioid overdose was in the first four weeks in treatment, aIRR of 3.11 (95\% CI 2.19--4.42). Conclusions: Retention on opioid agonist treatment is protective against drug related overdose. There is elevated risk of non-fatal overdose at treatment initiation that is not evident for fatal overdose, but the first month of treatment cessation is a critical period for both non-fatal and fatal overdose. These findings emphasize the importance of treatment retention and interventions for polysubstance overdose at cessation.}

  abstract = {Background Rates of abdominoperineal resection (APR) have been suggested as a solitary surrogate marker for comparing overall hospital quality in rectal cancer surgery. This study investigated the value of this marker by examining the associations between hospital APR rates and other quality indicators. Methods Hospital-level correlations between risk-adjusted APR rates for low rectal cancer and six risk-adjusted outcomes and six care processes were performed (such as 30-day mortality, complications, timely treatment). The ability of APR rates to discriminate between hospitals' performance was examined by means of hospital variance results in multilevel regression models and funnel plots. Results A linked population-based data set identified 1703 patients diagnosed in 2007 and 2008 who underwent surgery for rectal cancer. Some 15{$\cdot$}9 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 14{$\cdot$}2 to 17{$\cdot$}6) per cent of these patients had an APR. Among 707 people with low rectal cancer, 38{$\cdot$}2 (34{$\cdot$}6 to 41{$\cdot$}8) per cent underwent APR. Although risk-adjusted hospital rates of APR for low rectal cancer varied by up to 100 per cent, only one hospital (1 per cent) fell outside funnel plot limits and hospital variance in multilevel models was not very large. Lower hospital rates of APR for low rectal cancer did not correlate significantly with better hospital-level outcomes or process measures, except for recording of pathological stage (r = -0{$\cdot$}55, P = 0{$\cdot$}019). Patients were significantly more likely to undergo APR for low rectal cancer if they attended a non-tertiary metropolitan hospital (adjusted odds ratio 2{$\cdot$}14, 95 per cent c.i. 1{$\cdot$}11 to 4{$\cdot$}15). Conclusion APR rates do not appear to be a useful surrogate marker of overall hospital performance in rectal cancer surgery.},

Multilevel logistic regression models were used to determine whether age remained an independent predictor of adjuvant therapy utilisation after accounting for significant patient, surgeon and hospital characteristics. Results: Overall, 65-73\% of eligible patients received chemotherapy and 42-53\% received radiotherapy. Increasing age was strongly associated with decreasing likelihood of receiving chemotherapy for lymph node-positive colon cancer (p{$<$} 0.001) and radiotherapy for high-risk rectal cancer (p= 0.003), even after adjusting for confounders such as Charlson comorbidity score and ASA health status. People aged over 70. years for chemotherapy and over 75. years for radiotherapy were significantly less likely to receive treatment than those aged less than 65. Emergency resection, intensive care admission, and not having a current partner also independently predicted chemotherapy nonreceipt. Other predictors of radiotherapy nonreceipt included being female, not being discussed at multidisciplinary meeting, and lower T stage.

Design, setting and patients: Multilevel logistic regression analysis using a linked population-based dataset based on the records of patients with cancer of the colon, rectosigmoid junction or rectum who were registered in 2007 and 2008 by the NSW Central Cancer Registry and treated in 105 hospitals in NSW. Main outcome measures: Six outcome measures (30-day mortality, 28-day emergency readmission, prolonged length of stay, 30-day wound infection, 90-day venous thromboembolism, 1-year mortality) and five care process measures (discussion at multidisciplinary team [MDT] meeting, documented cancer stage, recorded pathological stage, treatment within 31 days of decision to treat, treatment within 62 days of referral). Results: We analysed data for 6890 people. There was wide variation between hospitals in care process measures, even after adjusting for patient and hospital factors. Older adults were less likely to be discussed at an MDT meeting and receive treatment within suggested time frames (all P{$<$} 0.001 for colon cancer). Increasing patient age, greater extent of disease, higher Charlson comorbidity score and resection after emergency admission consistently showed strong evidence of an association with poor outcomes. Much of the variation between hospitals in outcome measures was accounted for by patient characteristics. Conclusions: Patient characteristics should be included in risk-adjustment models for comparing outcomes between hospitals and for quantifying hospital variation. Further exploration of the reasons why certain hospitals and patients appear to be at risk of poorer care is needed.}

There was wide variation between hospitals in care process measures, even after adjusting for patient and hospital factors. Older adults were less likely to be discussed at an MDT meeting and receive treatment within suggested time frames (all P {$<~$}0.001~for colon cancer). Increasing patient age, greater extent of disease, higher Charlson comorbidity score and resection after emergency admission consistently showed strong evidence of an association with poor outcomes.

These datasets lack clinical details about important endpoints such as disease progression. Aim: To validate a proxy for disease progression in metastatic cancer patients using prescribing and dispensing claims. Methods: We used data from a cohort study of patients undergoing chemotherapy who provided informed consent to the collection of cancer-treatment data from medical records and linkage to pharmaceutical claims. We derived proxy decision rules based on changes to drug treatment in prescription histories (n = 36 patients) and validated the proxy in prescribing data (n = 62 patients). We adapted the decision rules and validated the proxy in dispensing data (n = 109). Our gold standard was disease progression ascertained in patient medical records. Individual progression episodes were the unit of analysis for sensitivity and Positive Predictive Value (PPV) calculations and specificity and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) were calculated at the patient level. Results: The sensitivity of our proxy in prescribing data was 74.3\% (95\% Confidence Interval (CI), 55.6--86.6\%) and PPV 61.2\% (95\% CI, 45.0--75.3\%); specificity and NPV were 87.8\% (95\% CI, 73.8--95.9\%) and 100\% (95\% CI, 90.3--100\%), respectively. In dispensing data, the sensitivity of our proxy was 64\% (95\% CI, 55.0--77.0\%) and PPV 56.0\% (95\% CI, 43.0--69.0\%); specificity and NPV were 81\% (95\% CI, 70.05--89.0\%) and 91.0\% (95\% CI, 82.0--97.0\%), respectively. Conclusion: Our proxy overestimated episodes of disease progression. The proxy's performance is likely to improve if the date of prescribing is used instead of date of dispensing in claims data and by incorporating medical service claims (such as imaging prior to drug changes) in the algorithm. Our proxy is not sufficiently robust for use in real world comparative effectiveness research for cancer medicines.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most proton pump inhibitors inhibit the bioactivation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. The clinical significance of this drug interaction is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a population-based nested case-control study among patients aged 66 years or older who commenced clopidogrel between Apr. 1, 2002, and Dec. 31, 2007, following hospital discharge after treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The cases in our study were those readmitted with acute myocardial infarction within 90 days after discharge. We performed a secondary analysis considering events within 1 year. Event-free controls (at a ratio of 3:1) were matched to cases on age, percutaneous coronary intervention and a validated risk score. We categorized exposure to proton pump inhibitors before the index date as current (within 30 days), previous (31-90 days) or remote (91-180 days). RESULTS: Among 13 636 patients prescribed clopidogrel following acute myocardial infarction, we identified 734 cases readmitted with myocardial infarction and 2057 controls. After extensive multivariable adjustment, current use of proton pump inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of reinfarction (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.57). We found no association with more distant exposure to proton pump inhibitors or in multiple sensitivity analyses. In a stratified analysis, pantoprazole, which does not inhibit cytochrome P450 2C19, had no association with readmission for myocardial infarction (adjusted OR 1.02, 95\% CI 0.70-1.47). INTERPRETATION: Among patients receiving clopidogrel following acute myocardial infarction, concomitant therapy with proton pump inhibitors other than pantoprazole was associated with a loss of the beneficial effects of clopidogrel and an increased risk of reinfarction.},

  abstract = {Objectives To assess how often stratified randomisation is used, whether analysis adjusted for all balancing variables, and whether the method of randomisation was adequately reported, and to reanalyse a previously reported trial to assess the impact of ignoring balancing factors in the analysis. Design Review of published trials and reanalysis of a previously reported trial. Setting Four leading general medical journals (BMJ, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine) and the second Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial (MIST2). Participants 258 trials published in 2010 in the four journals. Cluster randomised, crossover, non-randomised, single arm, and phase I or II trials were excluded, as were trials reporting secondary analyses, interim analyses, or results that had been previously published in 2010. Main outcome measures Whether the method of randomisation was adequately reported, how often balanced randomisation was used, and whether balancing factors were adjusted for in the analysis. Results Reanalysis of MIST2 showed that an unadjusted analysis led to larger P values and a loss of power. The review of published trials showed that balanced randomisation was common, with 163 trials (63\%) using at least one balancing variable. The most common methods of balancing were stratified permuted blocks (n=85) and minimisation (n=27). The method of randomisation was unclear in 37\% of trials. Most trials that balanced on centre or prognostic factors were not adequately analysed; only 26\% of trials adjusted for all balancing factors in their primary analysis. Trials that did not adjust for balancing factors in their analysis were less likely to show a statistically significant result (unadjusted 57\% v adjusted 78\%, P=0.02). Conclusion Balancing on centre or prognostic factors is common in trials but often poorly described, and the implications of balancing are poorly understood. Trialists should adjust their primary analysis for balancing factors to obtain correct P values and confidence intervals and to avoid an unnecessary loss in power.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Population-based observational studies have documented global increases in opioid analgesic use. Many studies have used a single population-adjusted metric (number of dispensings, defined daily doses [DDDs], or oral morphine equivalents [OMEs]). We combine these volume-based metrics with a measure of the number of persons dispensed opioids to gain insights into Australian trends in prescribed opioid use. METHODS: We obtained records of prescribed opioid dispensings (2006-2015) subsidised under Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We used dispensing claims to quantify annual changes in use according to 3 volume-based metrics: DDD/1000 pop/day, OME/1000 pop/day, and dispensings/1000 pop. We estimated the number of persons dispensed at least one opioid in a given year (persons)/1000 pop using data from a 10\% random sample of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme-eligible Australians. RESULTS: Total opioid use increased according to all metrics, especially OME/1000 pop/day (51\% increase) and dispensings/1000 pop (44\%). Weaker opioid use remained stable or declined; strong opioid use increased. The rate of persons accessing weaker opioids only decreased 31\%, and there was a 238\% increase in persons dispensed only strong opioids. Strong opioid use also increased according to dispensings/1000 pop (140\%), OME/1000 pop/day (80\%), and DDD/1000 pop/day (71\% increase). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the increases in total opioid use between 2006 and 2015 were predominantly driven by a growing number of people treated with strong opioids at lower medicine strengths/doses. This method can be used with or without person-level data to provide insights into factors driving changes in medicine use over time.},

  abstract = {AIM: The aim of this paper is to investigate 25-year trends in community use of prescribed opioid analgesics in Australia, and to map these trends against major changes to opioid registration and subsidy. METHODS: We obtained dispensing data from 1990 to 2014 from two sources: dispensing claims processed under Australia's national drug subsidy programme, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, including under co-payment records from 2012; and estimates of non-subsidized medicine use from a survey of Australian pharmacies (until 2011). Utilization was expressed in defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 population/day. RESULTS: Opioid dispensing increased almost four-fold between 1990 and 2014, from 4.6 to 17.4 DDD/1000 pop/day. In 1990, weak, short-acting or orally administered opioids accounted for over 90\% of utilization. Use of long-acting opioids increased over 17-fold between 1990 and 2000, due primarily to the subsidy of long-acting morphine and increased use of methadone for pain management. Between 2000 and 2011, oxycodone, fentanyl, buprenorphine, tramadol and hydromorphone use increased markedly. Use of strong opioids, long-acting and transdermal preparations also increased, largely following the subsidy of various opioids for noncancer pain. In 2011, the most dispensed opioids were codeine (41.1\% of total opioid use), oxycodone (19.7\%) and tramadol (16.1\%); long-acting formulations comprised approximately half, and strong opioids 40\%, of opioid dispensing. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid utilization in Australia is increasing, although these figures remain below levels reported in the US and Canada. The increased use of opioids was largely driven by the subsidy of long-acting formulations and opioids for the treatment of noncancer pain.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Average nightly sleep times precipitously decline from childhood through adolescence. There is increasing concern that historical shifts also occur in overall adolescent sleep time. METHODS: Data were drawn from Monitoring the Future, a yearly, nationally representative cross-sectional survey of adolescents in the United States from 1991 to 2012 (N = 272 077) representing birth cohorts from 1973 to 2000. Adolescents were asked how often they get {$\geq$}7 hours of sleep and how often they get less sleep than they should. Age-period-cohort models were estimated. RESULTS: Adolescent sleep generally declined over 20 years; the largest change occurred between 1991--1995 and 1996--2000. Age-period-cohort analyses indicate adolescent sleep is best described across demographic subgroups by an age effect, with sleep decreasing across adolescence, and a period effect, indicating that sleep is consistently decreasing, especially in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There was also a cohort effect among some subgroups, including male subjects, white subjects, and those in urban areas, with the earliest cohorts obtaining more sleep. Girls were less likely to report getting {$\geq$}7 hours of sleep compared with boys, as were racial/ethnic minorities, students living in urban areas, and those of low socioeconomic status (SES). However, racial/ethnic minorities and adolescents of low SES were more likely to self-report adequate sleep, compared with white subjects and those of higher SES. CONCLUSIONS: Declines in self-reported adolescent sleep across the last 20 years are concerning. Mismatch between perceptions of adequate sleep and actual reported sleep times for racial/ethnic minorities and adolescents of low SES are additionally concerning and suggest that health education and literacy approaches may be warranted.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Opioid dependence increases risk of premature mortality. Opioid substitution therapy with methadone or buprenorphine reduces mortality risk, especially for drug-related overdose. Clinical guidelines recommend methadone as the first line of opioid substitution therapy. We aimed to test whether buprenorphine treatment has a lower mortality risk than does methadone treatment by comparing all-cause mortality and drug-related overdose mortality at treatment induction, after in-treatment medication switches, and following treatment cessation. Methods We did a retrospective cohort study of all patients with opioid dependency (n=32\hphantom{,}033) in New South Wales, Australia, who started a methadone or buprenorphine treatment episode from Aug 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2010, including 190\hphantom{,}232{$\cdot$}6 person-years of follow-up. We compared crude mortality rates (CMRs) for all-cause and drug-related overdose mortality, and mortality rate ratios (MRRs) according to age, sex, period in or out of treatment, medication type, and in-treatment switching. Findings Patients who initiated with buprenorphine had reduced all-cause and drug-related mortality during the first 4 weeks of treatment compared with those who initiated with methadone (adjusted all-cause MRR 2{$\cdot$}17, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}29--3{$\cdot$}67; adjusted drug-related MRR 4{$\cdot$}88, 1{$\cdot$}73--13{$\cdot$}69). For the remaining time on treatment, drug-related mortality risk did not differ (adjusted MRR 1{$\cdot$}18, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}89--1{$\cdot$}56), but weak evidence suggested that all-cause mortality was lower for buprenorphine than methadone (1{$\cdot$}66, 1{$\cdot$}40--1{$\cdot$}96). In the 4 weeks after treatment cessation, all-cause mortality did not differ, but drug-related mortality was lower for methadone (adjusted all-cause MRR 1{$\cdot$}12, 0{$\cdot$}79--1{$\cdot$}59; adjusted drug-related MRR 0{$\cdot$}50, 0{$\cdot$}29--0{$\cdot$}86). Patients who switched from buprenorphine to methadone during treatment had lower mortality in the first 4 weeks of methadone treatment than matched controls who received methadone only (CMR difference 7{$\cdot$}1 per 1000 person-years, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}1--14{$\cdot$}0); no mortality difference was noted for switches from buprenorphine to methadone or for switches to either medication beyond the first 4 weeks of treatment. Interpretation In a setting with high risk of death in the first 4 weeks of opioid substitution therapy, buprenorphine seemed to reduce mortality in this period, but little difference between buprenorphine and methadone was noted thereafter or for in-treatment switching of medications. Cross-cohort corroboration of our findings and further assessment of the stepped treatment model is warranted. Funding Australian National Health \& Medical Research Council.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Australia has set the goal for the virtual elimination of HIV transmission by the end of 2022, yet accurate information is lacking on the level of HIV transmission occurring among residents. We developed a method for estimating the timing of HIV acquisition among migrants, relative to their arrival in Australia. We then applied this method to surveillance data from the Australian National HIV Registry with the aim of ascertaining the level of HIV transmission among migrants to Australia occurring before and after migration, and to inform appropriate local public health interventions. Methods: We developed an algorithm incorporating CD4+ T-cell decline back-projection and enhanced variables (clinical presentation, past HIV testing history and clinician estimate of the place of HIV acquisition) and compared it to a standard algorithm which uses CD4+ T-cell back-projection only. We applied both algorithms to all new HIV diagnoses among migrants to estimate whether HIV infection occurred before or after arrival in Australia. Results: Between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2020, 1909 migrants were newly diagnosed with HIV in Australia, 85\% were men, and the median age was 33 years. Using the enhanced algorithm, 932 (49\%) were estimated to have acquired HIV after arrival in Australia, 629 (33\%) before arrival (from overseas), 250 (13\%) close to arrival and 98 (5\%) were unable to be classified. Using the standard algorithm, 622 (33\%) were estimated to have acquired HIV in Australia, 472 (25\%) before arrival, 321 (17\%) close to arrival and 494 (26\%) were unable to be classified. Conclusions: Using our algorithm, close to half of migrants diagnosed with HIV were estimated to have acquired HIV after arrival in Australia, highlighting the need for tailored culturally appropriate testing and prevention programmes to limit HIV transmission and achieve elimination targets. Our method reduced the proportion of HIV cases unable to be classified and can be adopted in other countries with similar HIV surveillance protocols, to inform epidemiology and elimination efforts.}

  abstract = {Effect sizes are the most important outcome of empirical studies. Most articles on effect sizes highlight their importance to communicate the practical significance of results. For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The last year of life is one of the most resource-intensive periods for people with cancer. Very little population-based research has been conducted on end-of-life cancer care in the Australian health care setting. The objective of this program is to undertake a series of observational studies examining resource use, costs and quality of end-of-life care in a cohort of elderly cancer decedents using linked, routinely collected data. METHODS/DESIGN: This study forms part of an ongoing cancer health services research program. The cohorts for the end-of-life research program comprise Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs decedents with full health care entitlements, residing in NSW for the last 18 months of life and dying between 2005 and 2009. We used cancer and death registry data to identify our decedent cohorts and their causes of death. The study population includes 9,862 decedents with a cancer history and 15,483 decedents without a cancer history. The median age at death is 86 and 87 years in the cancer and non-cancer cohorts, respectively. We will examine resource use and associated costs in the last 6 months of life using linked claims data to report on health service use, hospitalizations, emergency department visits and medicines use. We will use best practice methods to examine the nature and extent of resource use, costs and quality of care based on previously published indicators. We will also examine factors associated with these outcomes. DISCUSSION: This will be the first Australian research program and among the first internationally to combine routinely collected data from primary care and hospital-based care to examine comprehensively end-of-life care in the elderly. The research program has high translational value, as there is limited evidence about the nature and quality of care in the Australian end-of-life setting.},

Methods The sample comprised participants interviewed as part of an annual cross-sectional survey of Australian people who inject drugs. Comparisons were made between groups according to the nature of their methamphetamine use: crystal methamphetamine or other forms of methamphetamine. Self-reported diagnoses of psychotic illness and other mental health problems were compared between groups. Predictors of self-reported psychotic illness were examined using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results Self-reported psychotic illness was highly prevalent among users of crystal methamphetamine (12.0\%), and significantly more so than among users of other forms of methamphetamine (3.9\%) (OR = 3.36; CI: 1.03-10.97). Significant predictors of self-reported psychosis in the cohort were: use of crystal methamphetamine; dependent use; lack of education beyond high school; and younger age.

Data were collected from several Australian states: New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania.

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Adult prisons in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Participants: 16 715 opioid-dependent people who were received to prison between 2000 and 2012. Interventions: Opioid substitution therapy. Primary outcome measures: Natural and unnatural (suicide, drug-induced, violent and other injury) deaths in prison. Results: Cohort members were in prison for 30 998 person-years (PY), during which time there were 51 deaths. The all-cause crude mortality rate (CMR) in prison was 1.6/1000 PY (95\% CI 1.2 to 2.2/1000 PY), and the unnatural death CMR was 1.1/1000 PY (95\% CI 0.8 to 1.6/1000 PY). Compared to time out of OST, the hazard of all-cause death was 74\% lower while in OST (adjusted HR (AHR): 0.26; 95\% CI 0.13 to 0.50), and the hazard of unnatural death was 87\% lower while in OST (AHR: 0.13; 95\% CI 0.05 to 0.35). The all-cause and unnatural death CMRs during the first 4 weeks of incarceration were 6.6/1000 PY (95\% CI 3.8 to 10.6/1000 PY) and 5.5/1000 PY (95\% CI 2.9 to 9.4/1000 PY), respectively. Compared to periods not in OST, the hazard of all-cause death during the first 4 weeks of incarceration was 94\% lower while in OST (AHR: 0.06; 95\% CI 0.01 to 0.48), and the hazard of unnatural death was 93\% lower while in OST (AHR: 0.07; 95\% CI 0.01 to 0.53). Conclusions: Mortality of opioid-dependent prisoners was significantly lower while in receipt of OST.}

Method: The Lions New South Wales Eye Bank (Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) provides the corneal transplantation service for Australia's most populous state. Over the 18-month period from 1 July 2004 to 31 December 2005 for all requests for donation, records were kept of which next of kin was asked for consent, the age of the deceased and the indication about donation by the deceased on their driving licence. Results: Over the 18-month study period, 841 people were approached about corneal donation. 63.2\% of those people approached gave their consent to donation. Increasing age of the deceased was significantly positively associated with consent to donation (p = 0.006). Multivariable univariate analysis adjusting for age of deceased showed that relative type was strongly associated with consent (p{$<$}0.001), with mothers and fathers more likely to donate than siblings, and siblings more likely to donate than children and spouses. An indication of willingness to donate on a driving licence was strongly associated with consent (p{$<$}0.001). Conclusions: Higher consent rates from older donors have implications for policies to maximise corneal procurement. The decision to donate on behalf of a deceased family member is complex and influenced by social context. Research should investigate individualised strategies to be used when seeking consent from particular categories of next of kin.}

  abstract = {Background: Pregnancy-associated cancer is associated with maternal morbidities and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and is reported to be increasing. Hospital discharge data have the potential to provide timely information on cancer incidence, which is central to evaluation and improvement of clinical care for women. This study aimed to assess the validity of hospital data for identifying incident pregnancy-associated cancers compared with incident cancers from an Australian population-based statutory cancer registry.Methods: Birth data from 2001-2008, comprised 470,277 women with 679,736 maternities, were linked to cancer registry and hospitalisation records to identify newly diagnosed cancers during pregnancy or within 12 months of delivery. Two hospital-identified cancer groups were examined; " index cancer hospitalisation" - first cancer admission per woman per pregnancy and " all cancer hospitalisations" -the total number of hospitalisations with a cancer diagnosis and women could have multiple hospitalisations during pregnancy. The latter replicates a scenario where identification of individuals is not possible and hospitalisations are used as the unit of analysis.Results: The incidence of pregnancy-associated cancer (according to cancer registry) was 145.4/100,000 maternities. Incidence of cancer was substantially over-estimated when using hospitalisations as the unit of analysis (incidence rate ratio, IRR 1.7) and under-estimated when using the individual (IRR 0.8). Overall, the sensitivity of " index cancer hospitalisation" was 60.4\%, positive predictive value (PPV) 77.7\%, specificity and negative predictive value both 100\%. Melanoma ascertainment was only 36.1\% and breast cancer 62.9\%. For other common cancers sensitivities ranged from 72.1\% to 78.6\% and PPVs 56.4\% to 87.3\%.Conclusion: Although hospital data provide another timely source of cancer identification, the validity is insufficient to obtain cancer incidence estimates for the obstetric population. {\copyright} 2013 Lee et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

  abstract = {Background: Pregnancy-associated cancer is associated with maternal morbidities and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and is reported to be increasing. Hospital discharge data have the potential to provide timely information on cancer incidence, which is central to evaluation and improvement of clinical care for women. This study aimed to assess the validity of hospital data for identifying incident pregnancy-associated cancers compared with incident cancers from an Australian population-based statutory cancer registry. Methods: Birth data from 2001-2008, comprised 470,277 women with 679,736 maternities, were linked to cancer registry and hospitalisation records to identify newly diagnosed cancers during pregnancy or within 12 months of delivery. Two hospital-identified cancer groups were examined; ``index cancer hospitalisation'' - first cancer admission per woman per pregnancy and ``all cancer hospitalisations'' - the total number of hospitalisations with a cancer diagnosis and women could have multiple hospitalisations during pregnancy. The latter replicates a scenario where identification of individuals is not possible and hospitalisations are used as the unit of analysis. Results: The incidence of pregnancy-associated cancer (according to cancer registry) was 145.4/100,000 maternities. Incidence of cancer was substantially over-estimated when using hospitalisations as the unit of analysis (incidence rate ratio, IRR 1.7) and under-estimated when using the individual (IRR 0.8). Overall, the sensitivity of ``index cancer hospitalisation'' was 60.4\%, positive predictive value (PPV) 77.7\%, specificity and negative predictive value both 100\%. Melanoma ascertainment was only 36.1\% and breast cancer 62.9\%. For other common cancers sensitivities ranged from 72.1\% to 78.6\% and PPVs 56.4\% to 87.3\%. Conclusion: Although hospital data provide another timely source of cancer identification, the validity is insufficient to obtain cancer incidence estimates for the obstetric population.}

  abstract = {Background and Aims: Alcohol consumption is a leading risk factor for premature mortality globally, but there are limited studies of broader cohorts of people presenting with alcohol-related problems outside of alcohol treatment services. We used linked health administrative data to estimate all-cause and cause-specific mortality among individuals who had an alcohol-related hospital inpatient or emergency department presentation. Design: Observational study using data from the Data linkage Alcohol Cohort Study (DACS), a state-wide retrospective cohort of individuals with an alcohol-related hospital inpatient or emergency department presentation. Setting: Hospital inpatient or emergency department presentation in New South Wales, Australia, between 2005 and 2014. Participants: Participants comprised 188 770 individuals aged 12 and above, 66\% males, median age 39 years at index presentation. Measurements: All-cause mortality was estimated up to 2015 and cause-specific mortality (by those attributable to alcohol and by specific cause of death groups) up to 2013 due to data availability. Age-specific and age--sex-specific crude mortality rates (CMRs) were estimated, and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using sex and age-specific deaths rates from the NSW population. Findings: There were 188 770 individuals in the cohort (1~079 249 person-years of observation); 27 855 deaths were recorded (14.8\% of the cohort), with a CMR of 25.8 [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 25.5, 26.1] per 1000 person-years and SMR of 6.2 (95\% CI = 5.4, 7.2). Mortality in the cohort was consistently higher than the general population in all adult age groups and in both sexes. The greatest excess mortality was from mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol use (SMR = 46.7, 95\% CI = 41.4, 52.7), liver cirrhosis (SMR = 39.0, 95\% CI = 35.5, 42.9), viral hepatitis (SMR = 29.4, 95\% CI = 24.6, 35.2), pancreatic diseases (SMR = 23.8, 95\% CI = 17.9, 31.5) and liver cancer (SMR = 18.3, 95\% CI = 14.8, 22.5). There were distinct differences between the sexes in causes of excess mortality (all causes fully attributable to alcohol female versus male risk ratio = 2.5 (95\% CI = 2.0, 3.1). Conclusions: In New South Wales, Australia, people who came in contact with an emergency department or hospital for an alcohol-related presentation between 2005 and 2014 were at higher risk of mortality than the general New South Wales population during the same period.}

  abstract = {Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are increasingly used to assess the effectiveness of health interventions. Three main analysis approaches are: cluster-level analyses, mixed-models and generalized estimating equations (GEEs). Mixed models and GEEs can lead to inflated type I error rates with a small number of clusters, and numerous small-sample corrections have been proposed to circumvent this problem. However, the impact of these methods on power is still unclear.We performed a simulation study to assess the performance of 12 analysis approaches for CRTs with a continuous outcome and 40 or fewer clusters. These included weighted and unweighted cluster-level analyses, mixed-effects models with different degree-of-freedom corrections, and GEEs with and without a small-sample correction. We assessed these approaches across different values of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), numbers of clusters and variability in cluster sizes.Unweighted and variance-weighted cluster-level analysis, mixed models with degree-of-freedom corrections, and GEE with a small-sample correction all maintained the type I error rate at or below 5\% across most scenarios, whereas uncorrected approaches lead to inflated type I error rates. However, these analyses had low power (below 50\% in some scenarios) when fewer than 20 clusters were randomized, with none reaching the expected 80\% power.Small-sample corrections or variance-weighted cluster-level analyses are recommended for the analysis of continuous outcomes in CRTs with a small number of clusters. The use of these corrections should be incorporated into the sample size calculation to prevent studies from being underpowered.},

  abstract = {Inverse probability of treatment weighting is a popular propensity score-based approach to estimate marginal treatment effects in observational studies at risk of confounding bias. A major issue when estimating the propensity score is the presence of partially observed covariates. Multiple imputation is a natural approach to handle missing data on covariates: covariates are imputed and a propensity score analysis is performed in each imputed dataset to estimate the treatment effect. The treatment effect estimates from each imputed dataset are then combined to obtain an overall estimate. We call this method MIte. However, an alternative approach has been proposed, in which the propensity scores are combined across the imputed datasets (MIps). Therefore, there are remaining uncertainties about how to implement multiple imputation for propensity score analysis: (a) should we apply Rubin's rules to the inverse probability of treatment weighting treatment effect estimates or to the propensity score estimates themselves? (b) does the outcome have to be included in the imputation model? (c) how should we estimate the variance of the inverse probability of treatment weighting estimator after multiple imputation? We studied the consistency and balancing properties of the MIte and MIps estimators and performed a simulation study to empirically assess their performance for the analysis of a binary outcome. We also compared the performance of these methods to complete case analysis and the missingness pattern approach, which uses a different propensity score model for each pattern of missingness, and a third multiple imputation approach in which the propensity score parameters are combined rather than the propensity scores themselves (MIpar). Under a missing at random mechanism, complete case and missingness pattern analyses were biased in most cases for estimating the marginal treatment effect, whereas multiple imputation approaches were approximately unbiased as long as the outcome was included in the imputation model. Only MIte was unbiased in all the studied scenarios and Rubin's rules provided good variance estimates for MIte. The propensity score estimated in the MIte approach showed good balancing properties. In conclusion, when using multiple imputation in the inverse probability of treatment weighting context, MIte with the outcome included in the imputation model is the preferred approach.},

  abstract = {The stepped wedge cluster randomized design has received increasing attention in pragmatic clinical trials and implementation science research. The key feature of the design is the unidirectional crossover of clusters from the control to intervention conditions on a staggered schedule, which induces confounding of the intervention effect by time. The stepped wedge design first appeared in the Gambia hepatitis study in the 1980s. However, the statistical model used for the design and analysis was not formally introduced until 2007 in an article by Hussey and Hughes. Since then, a variety of mixed-effects model extensions have been proposed for the design and analysis of these trials. In this article, we explore these extensions under a unified perspective. We provide a general model representation and regard various model extensions as alternative ways to characterize the secular trend, intervention effect, as well as sources of heterogeneity. We review the key model ingredients and clarify their implications for the design and analysis. The article serves as an entry point to the evolving statistical literatures on stepped wedge designs.},

Methods: Ecological analysis of zoster incidence related to timing of implementation of the national program in vaccine-targeted (70--79 years) and non-targeted age groups (60--69 and 80--89 years) during January 2013--December 2018 was estimated using interrupted time-series analyses. Results: Prior to program commencement (Jan 2013--Oct 2016) in patients aged 60--69, 70--79 and 80--89 years, incidence was mostly stable averaging respectively 7.2, 9.6 and 10.8 per 1000 person-years. In the two years following program commencement, incidence fell steadily in those aged 70--79 years, with an estimated decrease of 2.25 (95\% CI: 1.34, 3.17) per 1000 person-years per year, with women having a greater decrease than men (2.83 versus 1.68, p-interaction{$<$}0.01). In the two non-vaccine-program-targeted groups there was no evidence of reduction in zoster incidence: 60--69 years, 0.46 (95\% CI: -0.46, 1.38) and 80--89 years, 0.11 (95\% CI: -1.64, 1.87). Conclusions: Two years after implementation, an estimated 7000 zoster cases were prevented through the national program. With known waning vaccine efficacy, continued surveillance is needed to ensure these early reductions in incidence are sustained.}

  abstract = {Vaccine uptake in adult immunisation programs is often suboptimal. We aimed to assess the impact of the structured older persons health assessment (health assessment) on herpes zoster (zoster) vaccine uptake in Australia. We used national general practice electronic medical records (MedicineInsight) of encounters with patients aged 75--79 years because these patients were age-eligible for both free zoster vaccines and health assessments in the two years following the addition of zoster vaccine to the national immunisation program (Nov 2016--Dec 2018). Due to repeated encounters, we used generalized estimating equations with each patient treated as a clustering variable to analyse the comparison of rates of zoster vaccine administration during encounters where a health assessment was provided versus encounters where the health assessment was not provided. In analyses there were 31,876 patients with a total of 266,204 eligible general practice encounters. Of the 5018 encounters where a health assessment was provided, 592 zoster vaccinations also occurred on the same day (118.0/1000 encounters); for the 261,186 encounters where no health assessment was provided, 9226 zoster vaccinations occurred (35.3/1000 encounters). Zoster vaccine was more likely to be administered during a general practice encounter with a health assessment compared to encounters without one (adjusted odds ratio 2.99; 95\% CI: 2.76--3.23). In conclusion, the structured older persons health assessment, which acts as both an incentive and a reminder for healthcare providers to recommend vaccinations in adults improves uptake of zoster vaccine in eligible adults. Such interventions may have a role in improving vaccine uptake among older adults.}

  abstract = {Background: Few studies have examined effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19 and all-cause mortality across different pandemic periods in 2022. Methods: We used linked whole-of-population data from the 2021 Australian Census, Australian Immunisation Register, death registrations and other national datasets including migration data. Among 3.8 million adults aged 65+ years and {$>$}170,000 aged care residents, we used survival analysis to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 specific mortality and all-cause mortality, by vaccine dose and time since receipt, adjusted for age, sex and other factors. We also estimated absolute COVID-19 mortality rates. Findings: From January--May 2022 (Omicron BA.1/2), 3250 COVID-19 deaths occurred; from June--November (Omicron BA.4/5) 3185 COVID-19 deaths occurred. During January--May, VE of a 3rd COVID-19 vaccine dose within 3 months was 93\% (95\% CI 93--94\%) whilst VE of a 2nd dose {$>$}6 months since receipt was 34\% (26--42\%). During June--November, VE of a 4th COVID-19 vaccine dose within 3 months was 84\% (82--86\%) whilst VE of a 3rd dose {$>$}6 months since receipt was 56\% (50--62\%). VE estimates for aged care residents were similar, but absolute risk reductions were substantially greater. During June--November 2022, for all-cause mortality, VE of a 4th dose within 3 months was 58\% (56--59\%) whilst VE of a 3rd dose {$>$}6 months since receipt was 19\% (16--22\%). Interpretations: COVID-19 vaccination is highly effective against COVID-19 mortality among older adults although effectiveness wanes with time since the last dose. Our findings emphasise the importance of continuing to administer booster doses, particularly to those at highest risk.

Methods: We followed 94\% of all COVID-19 cases diagnosed in the Australian state of New South Wales between January and May 2020 using 3-4 weekly telephone interviews and linkage to hospitalisation and death data to determine if they had recovered from COVID-19 based on symptom resolution. Proportional hazards models with competing risks were used to estimate time to recovery adjusted for age and gender. Findings: In analyses 2904 cases were followed for recovery (median follow-up time 16 days, range 1-122, IQR 11-24).There were 2572 (88.6\%) who reported resolution of symptoms (262/2572 were also hospitalised), 224 (7.8\%) had not recovered at last contact (28/224 were also hospitalised), 51 (1.8\%) died of COVID-19, and 57 (2.0\%) were hospitalised without a documented recovery date. Of those followed, 20\% recovered by 10 days, 60\% at 20, 80\% at 30, 91\% at 60, 93\% at 90 and 96\% at 120 days. Compared to those aged 30-49 years, those 0-29 years were more likely to recover (aHR 1.22, 95\%CI 1.10-1.34) while those aged 50-69 and 70+ years were less likely to recover (aHR respectively 0.74, 95\%CI 0.67-0.81 and 0.63, 95\%CI 0.56-0.71). Men were faster to recover than women (aHR 1.20, 95\%CI 1.11-1.29) and those with pre-existing co-morbidities took longer to recover than those without (aHR 0.90, 95\%CI 0.83-0.98). Interpretation: In a setting where most cases of COVID-19 were ascertained and followed, 80\% of those with COVID-19 recover within a month, but about 5\% will continue to experience symptoms 3 months later.

  abstract = {Interrupted time series analysis differs from most other intervention study designs in that it involves a before-after comparison within a single population, rather than a comparison with a control group. This has the advantage that selection bias and confounding due to between-group differences are limited. However, the basic interrupted time series design cannot exclude confounding due to co-interventions or other events occurring around the time of the intervention. One approach to minimizse potential confounding from such simultaneous events is to add a control series so that there is both a before-after comparison and an intervention-control group comparison. A range of different types of controls can be used with interrupted time series designs, each of which has associated strengths and limitations. Researchers undertaking controlled interrupted time series studies should carefully consider a priori what confounding events may exist and whether different controls can exclude these or if they could introduce new sources of bias to the study. A prudent approach to the design, analysis and interpretation of controlled interrupted time series studies is required to ensure that valid information on the effectiveness of health interventions can be ascertained.},

Australian guidelines for 'Cancer Pain Management in Adults' are available on the Cancer Council Australia Cancer Guideline Wiki. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a suite of guideline implementation strategies for improving pain outcomes in adults with cancer in oncology and palliative care outpatient settings. METHODS: The study will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled design, with oncology and palliative care outpatient services as the clusters. Patients will be eligible if they are adults with cancer and pain presenting to participating services during the study period. During an initial control arm, services will routinely screen patients for average and worst pain over the past 24~h using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) and have unfettered access to online guidelines. During the intervention arm, staff at each service will be encouraged to use: 1) a patient education booklet and self-management resource; 2) an online spaced learning cancer pain education module for clinicians from different disciplines; and 3) audit and feedback of service performance on key indices of cancer pain screening, assessment and management. Service-based clinical change champions will lead implementation of these strategies. The trial's primary outcome will be the probability that patients initially screened as having moderate-severe ({$\geq$}5/10 NRS) worst pain experience a clinically important improvement one week later, defined as \,{$\geq$}\,30\% reduction. Secondary outcomes will include patient empowerment and quality of life, carer experience, and cost-effectiveness. For the main analysis, linear mixed models will be used, accounting for clustering and the longitudinal design. Eighty-two patients per service at six services (N\,=\,492) will provide {$>$}\,90\% power. A qualitative sub-study and analyses of structural and process factors will explore opportunities for further refinement and tailoring of the intervention. DISCUSSION: This pragmatic trial will inform implementation of guidelines across a range of oncology and palliative care outpatient service contexts. If found effective, the implementation strategies will be made freely available on the Wiki alongside the guidelines. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered 23/01/2015 on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12615000064505 ).},

The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.},

  abstract = {Background A principle of cohort studies is that cohort membership is defined by current rather than future exposure information. Pharmacoepidemiologic studies using existing databases are vulnerable to violation of this principle. We evaluated the impact of using data on future redemption of prescriptions to determine cohort membership, motivated by a published example seeking to emulate a ``per-protocol'' association between continuous versus never use of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and major bleeding (e.g., cerebral hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding). Materials and methods Danish medical registry data from 2004 to 2011 were used to construct two analytic cohorts. In Cohort 1, we used information about future redemption of low-dose ASA prescriptions to identify cohorts of continuous and never-ASA users. In Cohort 2, we identified ASA initiators and non-initiators using only contemporaneous data and censored follow-up for changes in use over time. We implemented propensity score-matched Poisson regression to evaluate associations between ASA use and major bleeding and estimated adjusted incidence rate differences (IRDs) per 1,000 person-years and ratios (IRRs) overall and stratified by time since initiation. Results Among {$>$}6 million eligible Danish adults, we identified 403,693 low-dose ASA initiators (Cohort 2), of whom 189,150 were defined as continuous users (Cohort 1). Overall, IRDs and IRRs were similar across cohorts. However, the IRD for major bleeding in the first 90 days was substantially larger in Cohort 1 (IRD=25 per 1,000 person-years) compared with Cohort 2 (IRD=10 per 1,000 person-years). Conclusion Using future medication redemption data to define baseline cohorts violates basic epidemiologic principles. Compared with an approach using only contemporaneous data to define cohorts, the approach based on future redemption data generated a substantially higher short-term association between low-dose ASA use and major bleeding on the absolute, but not the relative, scale possibly due to selection and immortal time biases.},

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting, participants: People who inject drugs who attended the Melbourne supervised injecting facility, 30 June 2018 -- 30 June 2020. Main outcome measures: Proportion of people tested for hepatitis C; proportions of people positive for anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA, and of eligible people prescribed direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment; sustained virological response twelve weeks or more after treatment completion. Results: Of 4649 people who attended the supervised injecting facility during 2018--20, 321 were tested for hepatitis C (7\%); 279 were anti-HCV antibody-positive (87\%), of whom 143 (51\%) were also HCV RNA-positive. Sixty-four of 321 had previously been treated for hepatitis C (20\%), 21 had clinically identified cirrhosis (7\%), eight had hepatitis B infections (2\%), and four had human immunodeficiency virus infections (1\%). In multivariate analyses, people tested for hepatitis C were more likely than untested clients to report psychiatric illness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 9.65; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 7.26--12.8), not have a fixed address (aOR, 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.18--2.14), and to report significant alcohol use (aOR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.06--2.32). The median number of injecting facility visits was larger for those tested for hepatitis C (101; interquartile range [IQR], 31--236) than for those not tested (20; IQR, 3--90). DAA treatment was prescribed for 126 of 143 HCV RNA-positive clients (88\%); 41 of 54 with complete follow-up data were cured (76\%). Conclusions: People who attend supervised injecting facilities can be tested and treated for hepatitis C on site. Models that provide streamlined, convenient hepatitis C care promote engagement with treatment in a group in which the prevalence of hepatitis C is high.},

  abstract = {Estimates of geographic variation among states and counties in the prevalence of opioid prescribing are developed using data from a large (135 million) representative national sample of opioid prescriptions dispensed during 2008 by 37,000 retail pharmacies. Statistical analyses are used to estimate the extent to which county variation is explained by characteristics of resident populations, their healthcare utilization, proxy measures of morbidity, availability of healthcare resources, and prescription monitoring laws. Geographic variation in prevalence of prescribed opioids is large, greater than the variation observed for other healthcare services. Counties having the highest prescribing rates for opioids were disproportionately located in Appalachia and in southern and western states. The number of available physicians was by far the strongest predictor of amounts prescribed, but only one-third of county variation is explained by the combination of all measured factors. Wide variation in prescribing opioids reflects weak consensus regarding the appropriate use of opioids for treating pain, especially chronic noncancer pain. Patients' demands for treatment have increased, more potent opioids have become available, an epidemic of abuse has emerged, and calls for increased government regulation are growing. Greater guidance, education, and training in opioid prescribing are needed for clinicians to support appropriate prescribing practices. Perspective Wide geographic variation that does not reflect differences in the prevalence of injuries, surgeries, or conditions requiring analgesics raises questions about opioid prescribing practices. Low prescription rates may indicate undertreatment, while high rates may indicate overprescribing and insufficient attention to risks of misuse.},

Analysis of incidental data from YouTube and RStudio Cloud show interesting distinctions. The formula section appeared to watch a larger proportion of pre-lab YouTube videos, but spend less time computing on RStudio Cloud. Conversely, the tidyverse section watched a smaller proportion of the videos and spent more time computing. Analysis of lab materials showed that tidyverse labs tended to be slightly longer in terms of lines in the provided RMarkdown materials, but not in minutes of the associated YouTube videos. The tidyverse labs exposed students to slightly more distinct R functions, but both labs relied on a quite small vocabulary of consistent functions, which can provide a starting point for instructors interested in teaching introductory statistics in R. Analysis of pre- and post-survey data show no differences between the two labs, so students appeared to have a positive experience regardless of section. This work provides additional evidence for instructors looking to choose between syntaxes for introductory statistics teaching.},

The purposes of this study were to validate a proxy for death in adult cancer patients and to assess its performance when estimating survival in two cohorts of cancer patients. METHODS: We evaluated 30-, 60-, 90- and 180-day proxies overall and by cancer type using data from 12 394 Australian veterans with lung, colorectal, breast or prostate cancer. The proxy indicated death if the difference between the last dispensing record and the end of the observational period exceeded the proxy cutoff. We then compared actual survival to 90-day proxy estimates in a subset of 4090 veterans with 'full entitlements' for pharmaceutical items and in 3704 Australian women receiving trastuzumab for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. RESULTS: The 90-day proxy was optimal with an overall sensitivity of 99.3\% (95\%CI: 98.4-99.7) and a specificity of 97.6\% (95\%CI: 91.8-99.4). These measures remained high when evaluated by cancer type and spread of disease. The application of the proxy using the most conservative date of death estimate (date of last dispensing) generally underestimated survival, with estimates up to 3\,months shorter than survival based on fact of death. CONCLUSIONS: A 90-day death proxy is a robust substitute to identify death in a chronic population when fact of death is not available. The proxy is likely to be valid across a range of chronic diseases as it relies on the presence of 'regular' dispensing records for individual patients.

  abstract = {Study objective: This didactical essay is directed to readers disposed to approach multilevel regression analysis (MLRA) in a more conceptual than mathematical way. However, it specifically develops an epidemiological vision on multilevel analysis with particular emphasis on measures of health variation (for example, intraclass correlation). Such measures have been underused in the literature as compared with more traditional measures of association (for example, regression coefficients) in the investigation of contextual determinants of health. A link is provided, which will be comprehensible to epidemiologists, between MLRA and social epidemiological concepts, particularly between the statistical idea of clustering and the concept of contextual phenomenon. Design and participants: The study uses an example based on hypothetical data on systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 25 000 people living in 39 neighbourhoods. As the focus is on the empty MLRA model, the study does not use any independent variable but focuses mainly on SBP variance between people and between neighbourhoods. Results: The intraclass correlation (ICC = 0.08) informed of an appreciable clustering of individual SBP within the neighbourhoods, showing that 8\% of the total individual differences in SBP occurred at the neighbourhood level and might be attributable to contextual neighbourhood factors or to the different composition of neighbourhoods. Conclusions: The statistical idea of clustering emerges as appropriate for quantifying ``contextual phenomena'' that is of central relevance in social epidemiology. Both concepts convey that people from the same neighbourhood are more similar to each other than to people from different neighbourhoods with respect to the health outcome variable.},

The aim of this study was to present measures of variation appropriate for the logistic case in a didactic rather than a mathematical way. Design and participants: Data were used from the health survey conducted in 2000 in the county of Scania, Sweden, that comprised 10 723 persons aged 18--80 years living in 60 areas. Conducting multilevel logistic regression different techniques were applied to investigate whether the individual propensity to consult private physicians was statistically dependent on the area of residence (that is, intraclass correlation (ICC), median odds ratio (MOR)), the 80\% interval odds ratio (IOR-80), and the sorting out index). Results: The MOR provided more interpretable information than the ICC on the relevance of the residential area for understanding the individual propensity of consulting private physicians. The MOR showed that the unexplained heterogeneity between areas was of greater relevance than the individual variables considered in the analysis (age, sex, and education) for understanding the individual propensity of visiting private physicians. Residing in a high education area increased the probability of visiting a private physician. However, the IOR showed that the unexplained variability between areas did not allow to clearly distinguishing low from high propensity areas with the area educational level. The sorting out index was equal to 82\%. Conclusion: Measures of variation in logistic regression should be promoted in social epidemiological and public health research as efficient means of quantifying the importance of the context of residence for understanding disparities in health and health related behaviour.},

To compare the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) morphine, intranasal (IN) fentanyl, and inhaled methoxyflurane when administered by paramedics to patients with moderate to severe pain. Methods. We conducted a retrospective comparative study of adult patients with moderate to severe pain treated by paramedics from the Ambulance Service of New South Wales who received IV morphine, IN fentanyl, or inhaled methoxyflurane either alone or in combination between January 1, 2004, and November 30, 2006. We used multivariate logistic regression to analyze data extracted from a clinical database containing routinely entered information from patient health care records. The primary outcome measure was effective analgesia, defined as a reduction in pain severity of {$\geq$}30 of initial pain score using an 11-point verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS-11). Results. The study population comprised 52,046 patients aged between 16 and 100 years with VNRS-11 scores of {$\geq$}5. All analgesic agents were effective in the majority of patients (81.8, 80.0, and 59.1 for morphine, fentanyl, and methoxyflurane, respectively). There was very strong evidence that methoxyflurane was inferior to both morphine and fentanyl (p {$<$} 0.0001). There was strong evidence that morphine was more effective than fentanyl (p 0.002). There was no evidence that combination analgesia was better than either fentanyl or morphine alone. Conclusion. Inhaled methoxyflurane, IN fentanyl, and IV morphine are all effective analgesic agents in the out-of-hospital setting. Morphine and fentanyl are significantly more effective analgesic agents than methoxyflurane. Morphine appears to be more effective than IN fentanyl; however, the benefit of IV morphine may be offset to some degree by the ability to administer IN fentanyl without the need for IV access. {\copyright} 2010 National Association of EMS Physicians.}

Methods: In this cluster randomised trial, primary care practises were randomised to either provide the link to the intervention or the control website. Primary health care attendees were invited by letter to opt into this study if they had at least one first-degree relative with MDD or BD and were asked to complete online questionnaires at baseline and 2-week follow-up. Results: Twenty general practices were a randomized, and 202 eligible patients completed both questionnaires. Thirty-nine (19.3\%) of participants were male and 163 (80.7\%) female. At follow-up, compared to controls, the intervention group: (i) were more likely to intend to undergo, or to have actually undergone, psychological therapies (OR = 5.83, 95\% CI: 1.58-21.47, p =.008); (ii) had better knowledge of depression risk factors and prevention strategies (mean difference = 0.47, 95\% CI: 0.05-0.88, p =.029); and (iii) were more likely to accurately estimate their lifetime risk of developing BD (mean difference = 11.2, 95\% CI: -16.52- -5.73, p {$<$}.001). There were no statistically significant between-group differences in change from baseline to follow up for any of the remaining outcome measures (Patient Health Questionnaire, Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Questionnaire and Perceived Risk of Developing MDD). Conclusion: The opt-in nature of the study may have led to participation bias, e.g. underrepresentation of males, and hence may limit generalisability to the broader population at familial risk for depression. This is the first website internationally focusing specifically on informational needs of those at familial risk of depression. Our interactive website can play an important role in improving the outcomes of individuals at familial risk for depression. Testing the intervention in other settings (e.g. psychology, psychiatry, genetic counselling) appears warranted.}

  abstract = {Background Opioids are a widely prescribed class of drug with potentially harmful short-term and long-term side effects. There are concerns about the amounts of these drugs being prescribed in England given that they are increasingly considered ineffective in the context of long-term non-cancer pain, which is one of the major reasons for their prescription. Aim To assess the amount and type of opioids prescribed in primary care in England, and patterns of regional variation in prescribing. Design and setting Retrospective observational study using publicly available government data from various sources pertaining to opioids prescribed in primary practice in England and Indices of Social Deprivation. Method Official government data were analysed for opioid prescriptions from August 2010 to February 2014. The total amount of opioid prescribed was calculated and standardised to allow for geographical comparisons. Results The total amount of opioid prescribed, in equivalent milligrams of morphine, increased (r = 0.48) over the study period. More opioids were prescribed in the north than in the south of England (r = 0.66, P{$<$}0.0001), and more opioids were prescribed in areas of greater social deprivation (r = 0.56, P{$<$}0.0001). Conclusion Long-term opioid prescribing is increasing despite poor efficacy for non-cancer pain, potential harm, and incompatibility with best practice. Questions of equality of care arise from higher prescription rates in the north of England and in areas of greater social deprivation. A national registry of patients with high opioid use would improve patient safety for this high-risk demographic, as well as provide more focused epidemiological data regarding patterns of prescribing.},

A key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some ``truth'' (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (``ADEMP''); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume~34 of Statistics in Medicine, which included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},

  abstract = {Summary. Longitudinal population-based surveys are widely used in the health sciences to study patterns of change over time. In many of these data sets unique patient identifiers are not publicly available, making it impossible to link the repeated measures from the same individual directly. This poses a statistical challenge for making inferences about time trends because repeated measures from the same individual are likely to be positively correlated, i.e., although the time trend that is estimated under the na{\"i}ve assumption of independence is unbiased, an unbiased estimate of the variance cannot be obtained without knowledge of the subject identifiers linking repeated measures over time. We propose a simple method for obtaining a conservative estimate of variability for making inferences about trends in proportions over time, ensuring that the type I error is no greater than the specified level. The method proposed is illustrated by using longitudinal data on diabetes hospitalization proportions in South Carolina.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess the methodological quality of studies on prediction models developed using machine learning techniques across all medical specialties. Design Systematic review. Data sources PubMed from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019. Eligibility criteria Articles reporting on the development, with or without external validation, of a multivariable prediction model (diagnostic or prognostic) developed using supervised machine learning for individualised predictions. No restrictions applied for study design, data source, or predicted patient related health outcomes. Review methods Methodological quality of the studies was determined and risk of bias evaluated using the prediction risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). This tool contains 21 signalling questions tailored to identify potential biases in four domains. Risk of bias was measured for each domain (participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis) and each study (overall). Results 152 studies were included: 58 (38\%) included a diagnostic prediction model and 94 (62\%) a prognostic prediction model. PROBAST was applied to 152 developed models and 19 external validations. Of these 171 analyses, 148 (87\%, 95\% confidence interval 81\% to 91\%) were rated at high risk of bias. The analysis domain was most frequently rated at high risk of bias. Of the 152 models, 85 (56\%, 48\% to 64\%) were developed with an inadequate number of events per candidate predictor, 62 handled missing data inadequately (41\%, 33\% to 49\%), and 59 assessed overfitting improperly (39\%, 31\% to 47\%). Most models used appropriate data sources to develop (73\%, 66\% to 79\%) and externally validate the machine learning based prediction models (74\%, 51\% to 88\%). Information about blinding of outcome and blinding of predictors was, however, absent in 60 (40\%, 32\% to 47\%) and 79 (52\%, 44\% to 60\%) of the developed models, respectively. Conclusion Most studies on machine learning based prediction models show poor methodological quality and are at high risk of bias. Factors contributing to risk of bias include small study size, poor handling of missing data, and failure to deal with overfitting. Efforts to improve the design, conduct, reporting, and validation of such studies are necessary to boost the application of machine learning based prediction models in clinical practice.

  abstract = {True intention-to-treat analyses are rare in reports of randomized clinical trials. To highlight the complex issues that arise in conducting and interpreting data from intention-to-treat analyses in studies with substantial levels of protocol violation (e.g. attrition, noncompliance, or withdrawal of participants), data from a clinical trial of treatment for cocaine dependence were analyzed using three strategies to manage missing data: Strategy 1 addressed the effectiveness of treatments based on data collected from participants up to the point of dropout. Strategy 2 addressed the effectiveness of treatments based on data from the full intended duration of the protocol including data collected after participant dropout. The third strategy used a more novel approach, which used an intention-to-treat strategy for the full duration of the trial and the full sample, but also evaluated the effect of treatment retention outcomes by including an independent variable to reflect active treatment retention as a time-varying covariate. Conclusions about the relative efficacy of the study treatments varied to some extent depending on the analytic strategy used. These findings suggest that investigators should make every effort to conduct intent-to-treat analyses, but also to make use of multiple analytic strategies to fully understand the effects of the treatments studied. Moreover, regardless of the strategy used, investigators should clearly describe their handling of data from participants who violate the protocol.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess how well the defined daily dose (DDD) metric reflects opioid utilisation among chronic non-cancer pain patients. DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional study, utilising a 7-day medication diary. SETTING: Community-based treatment settings, Australia. SUBJECTS: A sample of 1101 people prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. METHODS: Opioid dose data was collected via a self-completed 7-day medication diary capturing names, strengths and doses of each medication taken in the past week. Median daily dose was calculated for each opioid. Comparisons were made to the World Health Organization's (WHO) DDD metric. RESULTS: WHO DDDs ranged from 0.6 to 7.1 times the median opioid doses used by the sample. For transdermal fentanyl and oral hydromorphone, the median dose was comparable with the DDD. The DDD for methadone was 0.6 times lower than the median doses used by this sample of chronic pain patients. In contrast, the DDD for oxycodone and transdermal buprenorphine, the most commonly used strong opioids for chronic pain in Australia, was two to seven times higher than actual doses used. CONCLUSIONS: For many opioids, there are key differences between the actual doses used in clinical practice and the WHO's DDDs. The interpretation of opioid utilisation studies using population-level DDDs may be limited, and a recalibration of the DDD for many opioids or the reporting of opioid utilisation in oral morphine equivalent doses is recommended.

This review of reviews aimed to synthesise findings from high quality systematic reviews that examined the safety and effectiveness of cannabinoids in multiple sclerosis. We examined the outcomes of disability and disability progression, pain, spasticity, bladder function, tremor/ataxia, quality of life and adverse effects. RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 11 eligible systematic reviews providing data from 32 studies, including 10 moderate to high quality RCTs. Five reviews concluded that there was sufficient evidence that cannabinoids may be effective for symptoms of pain and/or spasticity in MS. Few reviews reported conclusions for other symptoms. Recent high quality reviews find cannabinoids may have modest effects in MS for pain or spasticity. Future research should include studies with non-cannabinoid comparators; this is an important gap in the evidence.},

Depending on which of the Levene tests that are being implemented, and particularly the Levene test based on means which is found in widely used software like SPSS, one may be using a statistical technique that is as bad (if not worse) than the F test which the Levene test was intended to replace.

While some of these criticisms are well-founded, frequently the use of various parametric methods such as analysis of variance, regression, correlation are faulted because: (a) the sample size is too small, (b) the data may not be normally distributed, or (c) The data are from Likert scales, which are ordinal, so parametric statistics cannot be used. In this paper, I dissect these arguments, and show that many studies, dating back to the 1930s consistently show that parametric statistics are robust with respect to violations of these assumptions. Hence, challenges like those above are unfounded, and parametric methods can be utilized without concern for ``getting the wrong answer''.},

Participants were aged 12 to 15 years.Main Outcome Measures The proportion meeting current guidelines for physical activity (60 min/d of moderate to vigorous physical activity) and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity assessed by self-reported participation in physical activity using the same questionnaire at both time points.Results All of the age and sex groups reported increases in both the prevalence of physical activity (mean increase range, 11.7\%-20.0\%) and in the minutes per week spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (median increase range, 135-175 minutes). These findings remained the same after additional adjustment for age, socioeconomic status, and cultural background.Conclusions Physical activity participation has considerably increased during the past 19 years among adolescents in the state of New South Wales, Australia. These findings provide important information about trends in compliance with physical activity recommendations and in time spent in physical activity. They could help to explain what aspects may need to be promoted to maximize the role of physical activity in reducing the high and increasing rates of child and adolescent obesity.},

Thus the purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive summary of the literature on statistics anxiety. In particular, the nature, etiology, and prevalence of statistics anxiety are described. Additionally, antecedents (i.e. dispositional, situational and environmental) of statistics anxiety are identified, as well as their effects on statistics achievement. Furthermore, existing measures of statistics anxiety are documented. Finally, based on the literature, successful interventions for reducing statistics anxiety are described.

  abstract = {Objective: Antidepressant use is widespread. While weight gain is a commonly reported side-effect of antidepressant use and has the potential to affect population health, there is little large-scale population-based evidence on the issue, particularly for long-term use ({$\geq$}12months). The aim of this study is to investigate the association between antidepressant use and weight change, including whether this relationship varies according to antidepressant class, recency of use, duration of use and dose. Methods: Annual percentage weight change was calculated from self-reported weight at two time-points from 20,751 participants aged {$\geq$}45years from the 45 and Up Study - a population-based cohort study from New South Wales, Australia. Antidepressant use, ascertained from linked pharmaceutical data, from 19months before baseline until end of follow-up (mean=3.3years of follow-up), was categorised as current, past-only, non-persistent or non-use. The association between antidepressant use and weight change was modelled using linear and multinomial logistic regressions and according to antidepressant class, recency, duration and dose. Results: Antidepressants were dispensed to 23\% of participants (n=4748) during the study period. Current antidepressant users were significantly more likely to gain {$>$}3\% of their body weight annually than non-users (adjusted relative risk ratio=1.19; 95\% confidence interval: [1.03, 1.38]); the risk increased with increasing dose among current users (p[trend]=0.003). Risk of weight gain did not vary significantly according to antidepressant class, recency or duration of use; however, statistical power was limited. No significant associations were found between antidepressant use and weight loss. Conclusion: Current antidepressant use was associated with modest but statistically significant annual gains in weight, with similar effects observed across the different classes of antidepressants used.}

  abstract = {Objective: Antidepressant use is widespread. While weight gain is a commonly reported side-effect of antidepressant use and has the potential to affect population health, there is little large-scale population-based evidence on the issue, particularly for long-term use (⩾12 months). The aim of this study is to investigate the association between antidepressant use and weight change, including whether this relationship varies according to antidepressant class, recency of use, duration of use and dose. Methods: Annual percentage weight change was calculated from self-reported weight at two time-points from 20,751 participants aged ⩾45 years from the 45 and Up Study -- a population-based cohort study from New South Wales, Australia. Antidepressant use, ascertained from linked pharmaceutical data, from 19 months before baseline until end of follow-up (mean = 3.3 years of follow-up), was categorised as current, past-only, non-persistent or non-use. The association between antidepressant use and weight change was modelled using linear and multinomial logistic regressions and according to antidepressant class, recency, duration and dose. Results: Antidepressants were dispensed to 23\% of participants (n = 4748) during the study period. Current antidepressant users were significantly more likely to gain {$>$}3\% of their body weight annually than non-users (adjusted relative risk ratio = 1.19; 95\% confidence interval: [1.03, 1.38]); the risk increased with increasing dose among current users (p[trend] = 0.003). Risk of weight gain did not vary significantly according to antidepressant class, recency or duration of use; however, statistical power was limited. No significant associations were found between antidepressant use and weight loss. Conclusion: Current antidepressant use was associated with modest but statistically significant annual gains in weight, with similar effects observed across the different classes of antidepressants used.},

Methods and analysis: We will assemble a retrospective cohort of people presenting to emergency departments and/or admitted to hospitals between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2014 in New South Wales, Australia with a diagnosis denoting an acute alcohol harm or problematic alcohol use. We will link these data with records from other healthcare services (eg, community-based mental healthcare data, cancer registry), mortality, offending and incarceration data sets. The four overarching areas for analysis comprise: (1) describing the characteristics of the cohort at their first point of contact with emergency and inpatient hospital services in the study period with a diagnosis indicating an acute alcohol harm and/or problematic alcohol use; (2) quantifying health service utilisation and law enforcement engagement; (3) quantifying rates of mortality, morbidity, offending and incarceration; and (4) assessing predictors (eg, age, sex) of mortality, morbidity, offending and incarceration among this cohort. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval has been provided by the New South Wales Population and Health Services Research Ethics Committee. We will report our findings in accordance with the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) statement and Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) where appropriate. We will publish data in tabular, aggregate forms only. We will not disclose individual results. We will disseminate project findings at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. We will aim to present findings to relevant stakeholders (eg, addiction medicine and emergency medicine specialists, policy makers) to maximise translational impact of research findings.}

We also examined patterns of, and factors associated with, new antidepressant treatment in cancer patients. METHODS: We followed 61\,067 antidepressant-naive Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs clients. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates to compare antidepressant initiation in clients with and without cancer and to assess how initiation varies with time from diagnosis, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, health service use and co-morbidities. RESULTS: 17.2\% (995/5795) of cancer patients initiated antidepressants and, on average, was more likely to initiate treatment than non-cancer controls with similar characteristics (initiation rate 9/100\,person-years, 95\% confidence interval: 8.5-9.6 vs 6.6/100\,person-years, 95\% confidence interval: 6.5-6.7). The peak initiation period was 12\,weeks before and 16\,weeks after diagnosis; cancer patients were 42\% more likely to commence therapy than non-cancer patients (adjusted hazard ratio\,=\,1.4, 1.2 to 1.7). Cancer patients with co-morbid disease, dispensed opioids, corticosteroids or anxiolytics and to whom death was approaching were more likely to initiate treatment. Median duration of antidepressant therapy was 16\,weeks. CONCLUSION: New antidepressant treatment is more common in cancer populations than in cancer-free populations. Treatment was most commonly initiated around diagnosis time, a period when cancer drug treatments also commence. The timing of peak antidepressant uptake suggests treatment may be for short-term adjustment reactions, better managed without drugs. Durations of treatment are shorter than recommended for depression.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

Hence, only individuals who have experienced an event are included and all time invariant confounding is eliminated. The temporal association between a transient exposure and an event is estimated. SCCS was originally developed for evaluation of vaccine safety, but has since been applied in a range of settings where exact information on the size of the population at risk is lacking or identification of an appropriate comparison group is difficult---eg, for studies of adverse effects of drug treatments. We provide an overview of the SCCS method, with examples of its use, discuss limitations, assumptions, and potential biases that can arise where assumptions are not met, and provide solutions and examples of good practice.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The aim of this study is to systematically review evidence on the factors associated with adolescent pregnancy in South Asia. This study was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Four electronic databases: EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched for relevant studies on factors associated with adolescent pregnancy in South Asia published in English between January 2000 and July 2022. The quality of the included studies was assessed using 12 criteria from The National Institute of Health (NIH) Study Quality Assessment Tools for observational studies. Of the 166 articles retrieved, only 15 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. Consistent factors associated with adolescent pregnancy in South Asia were low maternal education, low socioeconomic status, rural residency, and ethnic minorities. To prevent adolescent pregnancy in South Asia, concerted effort towards promoting health equity by addressing the predisposing factors associated with adolescent pregnancy is essential. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO [CRD42022340344].}

Despite the availability of nationally representative household survey data, there are limited studies that analyze factors associated with adolescent pregnancy across countries of South Asia. This study aimed to identify factors associated with adolescent pregnancy across South Asia. This study used the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from six countries in South Asia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan. Pooled individual record data from 20,828 ever-married women aged 15--19 years were used for the analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, informed by the World Health Organization framework on social determinants of health, was performed to examine factors associated with adolescent pregnancy. Adolescent pregnancy was highest in Afghanistan compared to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, India, and the Maldives. Multivariable analyses confirmed that being from a poor household or male-headed household, increasing maternal age, having no access to newspapers, and having no knowledge of family planning were significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy. The use or intention to use contraceptives was protective against adolescent pregnancy. To reduce adolescent pregnancy in South Asia, interventions targeting adolescents from poor households with limited access to mass media should be considered, especially those from households with an existing patriarchal structure.}

It is well recognized by statisticians and nonstatisticians alike that multiplicity inflates the type I error rate of the experiment, and this has prompted the development of many multiple comparison adjustment procedures. What has remained one of the thornier and more controversial points of contention among trialists today is the philosophy surrounding the need for multiplicity adjustment in clinical trials. This paper provides guidelines on how to deal with this complex issue in a practical manner. Through a series of scenarios and examples, we illustrate the fundamental issues surrounding the concept of multiplicity and point to some key questions one should ask when deliberating on the necessity and extent of adjustment for multiple comparisons.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The presence and severity of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) symptoms are thought to vary by microbiological etiology but there is limited empirical evidence. We sought to estimate and compare the rates of hospitalisation for PID temporally related to diagnoses of gonorrhoea and chlamydia. METHODS: All women, aged 15-45 years in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), with a diagnosis of chlamydia or gonorrhoea between 01/07/2000 and 31/12/2008 were followed by record linkage for up to one year after their chlamydia or gonorrhoea diagnosis for hospitalisations for PID. Standardised incidence ratios compared the incidence of PID hospitalisations to the age-equivalent NSW population. RESULTS: A total of 38,193 women had a chlamydia diagnosis, of which 483 were hospitalised for PID; incidence rate (IR) 13.9 per 1000 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) (95\%CI 12.6-15.1). In contrast, 1015 had a gonorrhoea diagnosis, of which 45 were hospitalised for PID (IR 50.8 per 1000 PYFU, 95\%CI 36.0-65.6). The annual incidence of PID hospitalisation temporally related to a chlamydia or gonorrhoea diagnosis was 27.0 (95\%CI 24.4-29.8) and 96.6 (95\%CI 64.7-138.8) times greater, respectively, than the age-equivalent NSW female population. Younger age, socio-economic disadvantage, having a diagnosis prior to 2005 and having a prior birth were also associated with being hospitalised for PID. CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia and gonorrhoea are both associated with large increases in the risk of PID hospitalisation. Our data suggest the risk of PID hospitalisation is much higher for gonorrhoea than chlamydia; however, further research is needed to confirm this finding.},

We quantified the risk of PID associated with chlamydia and gonorrhea infection and subsequent repeat infections in a whole-population cohort. Methods: A cohort of 315123 Western Australian women, born during 1974-1995, was probabilistically linked to chlamydia and gonorrhea testing records and to hospitalizations and emergency department presentations for PID from 2002 to 2013. Time-updated survival analysis was used to investigate the association between chlamydia and gonorrhea testing, and positivity, and risk of PID. Results: Over 3199135 person-years, 120748 women had pathology test records for both chlamydia and gonorrhea, 10745 chlamydia only, and 653 gonorrhea only. Among those tested, 16778 (12.8\%) had {$\geq$}1 positive chlamydia test, 3195 (2.6\%) {$\geq$}1 positive gonorrhea test, and 1874 (1.6\%) were positive for both. There were 4819 PID presentations (2222 hospitalizations, 2597 emergency presentations). Adjusting for age, Aboriginality, year of follow-up, health area, and socioeconomic status, compared to women negative for chlamydia and gonorrhea, the relative risk (adjusted incidence rate ratio) of PID was 4.29 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.66-5.03) in women who were both chlamydia and gonorrhea positive; 4.54 (95\% CI, 3.87-5.33) in those only gonorrhea positive; and 1.77 (95\% CI, 1.61-1.94) in those only chlamydia positive. Conclusions: Gonorrhea infection conferred a substantially higher risk than chlamydia of hospitalization or emergency department presentation for PID. The emergence of gonorrhea antimicrobial resistance may have a serious impact on rates of PID and its associated reproductive health sequelae.},

METHODS: A cohort of 318002 women, born between 1974 and 1995, residing in Western Australia (WA) was determined from birth registrations and the 2014 electoral roll. This cohort was then probabilistically linked to all records of chlamydia and gonorrhoea nucleic acid amplification tests conducted by two large WA pathology laboratories between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2013. Trends in chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing and positivity were investigated over time and stratified by Aboriginality and age group. RESULTS: The proportion of women tested annually for chlamydia increased significantly between 2001 and 2013 from 24.5\% to 36.6\% in Aboriginal and 4.0\% to 8.5\% in non-Aboriginal women (both P-values {$<$}0.001). Concurrent testing was high ({$>$}80\%) and so patterns of gonorrhoea testing were similar. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea positivity were substantially higher in Aboriginal compared with non-Aboriginal women; age-, region- and year-adjusted incidence rate ratios were 1.52 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.50-1.69, P{$<$}0.001) and 11.80 (95\% CI 10.77-12.91, P{$<$}0.001) respectively. Chlamydia positivity increased significantly in non-Aboriginal women aged 15-19 peaking in 2011 at 13.3\% (95\% CI 12.5-14.2\%); trends were less consistent among 15-19-year-old Aboriginal women but positivity also peaked in 2011 at 18.5\% (95\% CI 16.9-20.2\%). Gonorrhoea positivity was 9.7\% (95\% CI 9.3-10.1\%), 6.7\% (95\% CI 6.4-7.0\%), 4.7\% (4.4-5.0\%), and 3.1\% (2.8-3.4\%) among Aboriginal women aged respectively 15-19, 20-24, 25-29 and {$\geq$}30 years, compared with {$<$}1\% in all age groups in non-Aboriginal women. Over time, gonorrhoea positivity declined in all age groups among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women. CONCLUSION: Between 2001 and 2013 in WA chlamydia and gonorrhoea positivity remained highest in young Aboriginal women despite chlamydia positivity increasing among young non-Aboriginal women. More effective prevention strategies, particularly for young Aboriginal women, are needed to address these disparities.},

  abstract = {In the medical literature, hundreds of prediction models are being developed to predict health outcomes in individuals. For continuous outcomes, typically a linear regression model is developed to predict an individual's outcome value conditional on values of multiple predictors (covariates). To improve model development and reduce the potential for overfitting, a suitable sample size is required in terms of the number of subjects (n) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) for potential inclusion. We propose that the minimum value of n should meet the following four key criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of {$\geq$}0.9; (ii) small absolute difference of {$\leq$} 0.05 in the apparent and adjusted R2; (iii) precise estimation (a margin of error {$\leq$} 10\% of the true value) of the model's residual standard deviation; and similarly, (iv) precise estimation of the mean predicted outcome value (model intercept). The criteria require prespecification of the user's chosen p and the model's anticipated R2 as informed by previous studies. The value of n that meets all four criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. In an applied example, a new model to predict lung function in African-American women using 25 predictor parameters requires at least 918 subjects to meet all criteria, corresponding to at least 36.7 subjects per predictor parameter. Even larger sample sizes may be needed to additionally ensure precise estimates of key predictor effects, especially when important categorical predictors have low prevalence in certain categories.},

  abstract = {When designing a study to develop a new prediction model with binary or time-to-event outcomes, researchers should ensure their sample size is adequate in terms of the number of participants (n) and outcome events (E) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) considered for inclusion. We propose that the minimum values of n and E (and subsequently the minimum number of events per predictor parameter, EPP) should be calculated to meet the following three criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of {$\geq$}0.9, (ii) small absolute difference of {$\leq$} 0.05 in the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R2, and (iii) precise estimation of the overall risk in the population. Criteria (i) and (ii) aim to reduce overfitting conditional on a chosen p, and require prespecification of the model's anticipated Cox-Snell R2, which we show can be obtained from previous studies. The values of n and E that meet all three criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. Upon application of our approach, a new diagnostic model for Chagas disease requires an EPP of at least 4.8 and a new prognostic model for recurrent venous thromboembolism requires an EPP of at least 23. This reinforces why rules of thumb (eg, 10 EPP) should be avoided. Researchers might additionally ensure the sample size gives precise estimates of key predictor effects; this is especially important when key categorical predictors have few events in some categories, as this may substantially increase the numbers required.},

  abstract = {AIMS: We examined potential risk of serotonin toxicity in Australian veterans by quantifying the concomitant use of serotonergic medicine combinations from claims data collected by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 273 228 Australian veterans, war widows, widowers and dependents aged {$>$}or=55 years and holding full treatment entitlement for the period July 2000 to June 2004 or until death. The main outcome measure was potential concomitant use, estimated as the number of cohort members with an overlap in days of supply for serotonergic medicine combinations over the 4 year period for all medicine combinations and potentially life threatening combinations. RESULTS: From July 2000 to June 2004, 115 969 (42\%) cohort members were dispensed at least one serotonergic medicine. 20 658 (8\%) had at least one episode of potential concomitant use. We identified 1811 (0.7\%) cohort members with at least one overlapping period of potentially life-threatening serotonergic medicine combinations, 937 of whom had the combinations dispensed within the recommended washout period. Three hundred and seventeen of these individuals were dispensed potentially life-threatening medicine combinations on the same day. The most common combinations were moclobemide with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or tramadol. CONCLUSIONS: The individuals potentially at risk of mild to moderate serotonin toxicity were considerable and potentially life threatening combinations were not infrequent. While we were unable to determine how many individuals experienced serotonin toxicity this study indicates, for the first time, the potential size of the problem in a subgroup of elderly Australians. Clinicians and patients need to be vigilant regarding inadvertent concomitant use, especially that of moclobemide with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or tramadol.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims: The configuration of alcohol and other drug treatment service systems has been influenced by the uptake of market mechanisms for treatment funding and purchasing. This study measured the impact of market mechanisms for funding and purchasing alcohol and drug treatment services on client outcomes. Design: An observational cross-sectional study, employing multi-level analysis: episodes of care data, nested within person-level data, nested within treatment site and nested within organization. Setting and participants: One hundred and seventy-eight alcohol and other drug treatment service sites in Australia. Measurements: Client outcome variables were length of stay and successful treatment completion. Predictor variables were competitive tendering, number of funding contracts, recurrent funding, the ratio of episodes to staff, type of professions, years of clinical experience, staff turnover and type of provider (government; non-government). Analyses controlled for drug type, type of treatment received and client characteristics. Findings: There were no significant associations between the procurement and contracting variables and length of stay [incidence rate ratios (IRRs) ranged between 1.01 and 1.07, all P {$>$} 0.05; Bayes factors (BF) {$<$} 0.03], and inconclusive results for treatment completion [odds ratios (ORs) ranged between 1.04 and 1.15, all P {$>$} 0.05, BF = 0.51--0.63]. Having an alcohol and other drug (AOD) work-force relative to an `other' work-force (IRR = 0.79, P = 0.021) and lower case-loads (IRR = 0.99, P = 0.047) may be associated with longer stay in treatment. Receiving services from a government compared to non-government provider may also be associated with less treatment completion (OR = 0.34, P = 0.023, BF = 2.14). Conclusions: There appears to be no association between client outcomes and procurement and funding contract arrangements for alcohol and drug treatment services.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burden of patients with heart failure on health care systems is widely recognised, although there have been few attempts to quantify individual patterns of care and differences in health service utilisation related to age, socio-economic factors and the presence of co-morbidities. The aim of this study was to assess the typical profile, trajectory and resource use of a cohort of Australian patients with heart failure using linked population-based, patient-level data. METHODS: Using hospital separations (Admitted Patient Data Collection) with death registrations (Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages) for the period 2000-2007 we estimated age- and gender-specific rates of index admissions and readmissions, risk factors for hospital readmission, mean length of stay (LOS), median survival and bed-days occupied by patients with heart failure in New South Wales, Australia. RESULTS: We identified 29,161 index admissions for heart failure. Admission rates increased with age, and were higher for males than females for all age groups. Age-standardised rates decreased over time (256.7 to 237.7/100,000 for males and 235.3 to 217.1/100,000 for females from 2002-3 to 2006-7; p\,=\,0.0073 adjusted for gender). Readmission rates (any cause) were 27\% and 73\% at 28-days and one year respectively; readmission rates for heart failure were 11\% and 32\% respectively. All cause mortality was 10\% and 28\% at 28 days and one year. Increasing age was associated with more heart failure readmissions, longer LOS and shorter median survival. Increasing age, increasing Charlson comorbidity score and male gender were risk factors for hospital readmission. Cohort members occupied 954,888 hospital bed-days during the study period (any cause); 383,646 bed-days were attributed to heart failure admissions. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of index admissions for heart failure decreased significantly in both males and females over the study period. However, the impact on acute care hospital beds was substantial, with heart failure patients occupying almost 200,000 bed-days per year in NSW over the five year study period. The strong age-related trends highlight the importance of stabilising elderly patients before discharge and community-based outreach programs to better manage heart failure and reduce readmissions.},

RESULTS: Each data source had limitations, and provided different, but complementary information. HIC data allowed calculation of prescribing rates (prescriptions per 100 Medicare services), but had incomplete capture of information on some classes of drugs, and no information on the patients receiving the drugs or the indications for the use of the drugs. The HUDGP database could only provide information on choice of agent when the decision to prescribe something had been made. However, it provided the context information (patient characteristics, indication for use, other medications) that could permit some assessment of the appropriateness of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: HIC data may be useful for an overall assessment of divisional activities. However, for a full assessment of the quality of prescribing at the level of individual GPs, additional patient related information is required. This requires much wider use of electronic prescribing packages that can capture the clinical details needed to review the appropriateness of treatment decisions.}

Methods: Analysis of prospectively collected data from the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC). Severity of overdose was measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale, oxygen saturation levels, and the administration of naloxone. Results: Heroin overdoses occurred at three times the rate of oxycodone overdoses (12.7 v 4.1 per 1000 injections). Heroin overdoses appeared to be more severe-than oxycodone overdoses, with higher levels of compromised consciousness (31 v 18\%) and severe respiratory depression (67 v 48\%), but there were no differences in naloxone doses (20 v 17\%). Concurrent use of other depressants at the time of overdose was also associated with compromised consciousness, and the need for naloxone. Conclusions: Heroin overdoses occurred at a greater rate than oxycodone overdoses, and had more severe clinical indicators.},

The current study aimed to examine trends in opioid overdose deaths by: 1) opioid type (heroin and pharmaceutical opioids); and 2) age, gender, and intent of the death assigned by the coroner. Methods Analysis of data from the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) of opioid overdose deaths occurring between 2001 and 2012. Results Deaths occurred predominantly (98\%) among Australians aged 15--74 years. Approximately two-thirds of the decedents (68\%) were male. The heroin overdose death rate remains unchanged over the period; these were more likely to occur among males. Pharmaceutical opioid overdose deaths increased during the study period (from 21.9 per million population in 2001--36.2), and in 2012 they occurred at 2.5 times the incident rate of heroin overdose deaths. Increases in pharmaceutical opioid deaths were largely driven by accidental overdoses. They were more likely to occur among males than females, and highest among Australians aged 45--54 years. Rates of fentanyl deaths in particular showed an increase over the study period (from a very small number at the beginning of the period) but in 2012 rates of morphine deaths were higher than those for oxycodone, fentanyl and tramadol. Conclusions Given the increase in rates of pharmaceutical opioid overdose deaths, it is imperative to implement strategies to reduce pharmaceutical opioid-related mortality, including more restrictive prescribing practices and increasing access to treatment for opioid dependence.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been international concern over the rise in fatal pharmaceutical opioid overdose rates, driven by increased opioid analgesic prescribing. The current study aimed to examine trends in opioid overdose deaths by: 1) opioid type (heroin and pharmaceutical opioids); and 2) age, gender, and intent of the death assigned by the coroner. METHODS: Analysis of data from the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) of opioid overdose deaths occurring between 2001 and 2012. RESULTS: Deaths occurred predominantly (98\%) among Australians aged 15-74 years. Approximately two-thirds of the decedents (68\%) were male. The heroin overdose death rate remains unchanged over the period; these were more likely to occur among males. Pharmaceutical opioid overdose deaths increased during the study period (from 21.9 per million population in 2001-36.2), and in 2012 they occurred at 2.5 times the incident rate of heroin overdose deaths. Increases in pharmaceutical opioid deaths were largely driven by accidental overdoses. They were more likely to occur among males than females, and highest among Australians aged 45-54 years. Rates of fentanyl deaths in particular showed an increase over the study period (from a very small number at the beginning of the period) but in 2012 rates of morphine deaths were higher than those for oxycodone, fentanyl and tramadol. CONCLUSIONS: Given the increase in rates of pharmaceutical opioid overdose deaths, it is imperative to implement strategies to reduce pharmaceutical opioid-related mortality, including more restrictive prescribing practices and increasing access to treatment for opioid dependence.},

  abstract = {Often in the study of behavioral ecology, and more widely in science, we require to statistically test whether the central tendencies (mean or median) of 2 groups are different from each other on the basis of samples of the 2 groups. In surveying recent issues of Behavioral Ecology (Volume 16, issues 1--5), I found that, of the 130 papers, 33 (25\%) used at least one statistical comparison of this sort. Three different tests were used to make this comparison: Student's t-test (67 occasions; 26 papers), Mann--Whitney U test (43 occasions; 21 papers), and the t-test for unequal variances (9 occasions; 4 papers). My aim in this forum article is to argue for the greater use of the last of these tests. The numbers just related suggest that this test is not commonly used. In my survey, I was able to identify tests described simply as ``t-tests'' with confidence as either a Student's t-test or an unequal variance t-test because the calculation of degrees of freedom from the 2 sample sizes is different for the 2 tests (see below). Hence, the neglect of the unequal variance t-test illustrated above is a real phenomenon and can be explained in several (nonexclusive ways) ways:Argument 4 relies on the central limit theorem and would require a combined sample size of at least 30 (Sokal and Rohlf 1987, p. 107); however, in my survey, the majority (47 out of 61) of tests for which sample sizes were provided had a combined sample size below 30. The fallacy of argument 3 has been demonstrated previously on several occasions (e.g., Kasuya 2001; Neuhauser 2002). To explore argument 1 further, imagine that we have 2 sample groups (labeled ``1'' and ``2,'' with means [{$\mu$}1 and {$\mu$}2], variances [{\textbackslash}batchmode {\textbackslash}documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amssymb\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsfonts\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsmath\} {\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\} {\textbackslash}begin\{document\} {\textbackslash}(s\_\{1\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}) {\textbackslash}end\{document\} and {\textbackslash}batchmode {\textbackslash}documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amssymb\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsfonts\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsmath\} {\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\} {\textbackslash}begin\{document\} {\textbackslash}(s\_\{2\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}) {\textbackslash}end\{document\}], and sample sizes [N1 and N2]).

Hence, we can see the need for the underlying assumption of equal population variances in this test. The Student's t-test performs badly when these variances are actually unequal, both in terms of Type I and Type II errors (Zar 1996). Figure 1 suggests that unequal sample variances are common in behavioral ecology. Although it is true that unequal variances are less problematic if sample sizes are similar, in practice, we often have quite unequal sample sizes (Figure 2). Hence, I suggest that the Student's t-test is frequently used in behavioral ecology when one of its important underlying assumptions is violated, and consequently, its performance is unreliable.},

  abstract = {The world is becoming increasingly complex, both in terms of the rich sources of data we have access to as well as in terms of the statistical and computational methods we can use on those data. These factors create an ever-increasing risk for errors in our code and sensitivity in our findings to data preparation and execution of complex statistical and computing methods. The consequences of coding and data mistakes can be substantial. Openness (e.g., providing others with data code) and transparency (e.g., requiring that data processing and code follow standards) are two key solutions to help alleviate concerns about replicability and errors. In this paper, we describe the key steps for implementing a code quality assurance (QA) process for researchers to follow to improve their coding practices throughout a project to assure the quality of the final data, code, analyses and ultimately the results. These steps include: (i) adherence to principles for code writing and style that follow best practices, (ii) clear written documentation that describes code, workflow and key analytic decisions; (iii) careful version control, (iv) good data management; and (iv) regular testing and review. Following all these steps will greatly improve the ability of a study to assure results are accurate and reproducible. The responsibility for code QA falls not only on individual researchers but institutions, journals, and funding agencies as well.},

More recently, many alternative approaches to address these two challenges have been proposed, but knowledge of their properties and meaningful comparisons between them are scarce. To define a state of the art and to provide evidence-supported guidance to researchers who have only a basic level of statistical knowledge, many outstanding issues in multivariable modelling remain.

Methods We identified people with a cancer registry notification of CUP (n = 327) from the 45 and Up Study, a prospective cohort of 266,724 people 45 years in New South Wales, Australia, matched with up to three controls with a diagnosis of metastatic cancer of known primary (n = 977). Baseline questionnaire data were linked to population health data to identify all health service use, diagnostic tests, and procedures in the month of diagnosis and 3 months prior. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Results After adjusting for age and educational attainment, people with a cancer-registry notified CUP diagnosis were more likely to be an aged care resident (OR = 2.78, 95\%CI 1.37-5.63), have an emergency department visit (OR = 1.65, 95\%CI 1.23-2.21), serum tumor marker tests (OR = 1.51, 95\%CI 1.12-2.04), or a cytology test without immunohistochemistry (OR = 2.01, 95\%CI 1.47-2.76), and less likely to have a histopathology test without immunohistochemistry (OR = 0.43, 95\%CI 0.31-0.59). Neither general practitioner, specialist, allied health practitioner or nurse consultations, hospitalisations, nor imaging procedures were associated with a CUP diagnosis. Conclusions The health service and diagnostic pathway to diagnosis differs markedly for people notified with CUP compared to those with metastatic cancer of known primary. While these differences may indicate missed opportunities for earlier detection and appropriate management, for some patients they may be clinically appropriate.}

  abstract = {AIMS: We describe choice of first-line antihypertensive drug therapy and uptake of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) in Australia, and investigate the impact of initiation on FDCs and other non-recommended first-line therapies on treatment discontinuation. METHOD: This was a population-based retrospective cohort study using a random 10\% sample of persons dispensed an Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listed medicine from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2014. The primary outcomes were adherence to Australian recommendations at initiation of antihypertensive therapy, discontinuation of initial therapy and discontinuation of any therapy in the first year after initiation. RESULTS: In our sample of 55 937 persons initiating therapy, 42.0\% did so outside Australian recommendations, including not initiating on recommended monotherapy (26.3\%) and not initiating on the lowest recommended dose (30.6\%). Only 1.7\% of individuals who were dispensed an FDC established therapy on the free combination regimen (as recommended) prior to switching. After adjusting for covariates, persons initiating on non-recommended monotherapy (OR = 2.64, 95\% CI 2.47-2.83) or FDCs of two or more antihypertensives (OR = 1.42, 95\% CI 1.30-1.55), were more likely to discontinue all antihypertensive drug treatment in the first year compared to persons initiating on recommended monotherapy. CONCLUSION: More than half of antihypertensive initiators conformed to Australian guidelines. Initiation on FDCs and other non-recommended treatments was associated with lower persistence on antihypertensive therapy in the first year. Long-term effectiveness and outcomes may be enhanced by initiating with low dose monotherapy.},

While segmented regression is a common approach, it is not always adequate, especially in the presence of seasonality and autocorrelation.

Methods: We describe the underlying theory behind ARIMA models and how they can be used to evaluate population-level interventions, such as the introduction of health policies. We discuss how to select the shape of the impact, the model selection process, transfer functions, checking model fit, and interpretation of findings. We also provide R and SAS code to replicate our results. Results: We illustrate ARIMA modelling using the example of a policy intervention to reduce inappropriate prescribing. In January 2014, the Australian government eliminated prescription refills for the 25 mg tablet strength of quetiapine, an antipsychotic, to deter its prescribing for non-approved indications. We examine the impact of this policy intervention on dispensing of quetiapine using dispensing claims data. Conclusions: ARIMA modelling is a useful tool to evaluate the impact of large-scale interventions when other approaches are not suitable, as it can account for underlying trends, autocorrelation and seasonality and allows for flexible modelling of different types of impacts. {\copyright} 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Introduction: Prescriber behaviour is important for understanding opioid use patterns. We described variations in practitioner-level opioid prescribing in New South Wales, Australia (2013--2018). Methods: We quantified opioid prescribing patterns among medical practitioners using population-level dispensing claims data, and used partitioning around medoids to identify clusters of practitioners who prescribe opioids based on prescribing patterns and patient characteristics identified from linked dispensing claims, hospitalisations and mortality data. Results: The number of opioid prescribers ranged from 20,179 in 2013 to 23,408 in 2018. The top 1\% of practitioners prescribed 15\% of all oral morphine equivalent (OME) milligrams dispensed annually, with a median of 1382 OME grams (interquartile range [IQR], 1234--1654) per practitioner; the bottom 50\% prescribed 1\% of OMEs dispensed, with a median of 0.9 OME grams (IQR 0.2--2.6). Based on 63.6\% of practitioners with {$\geq$}10 patients filling opioid prescriptions in 2018, we identified four distinct practitioner clusters. The largest cluster prescribed multiple analgesic medicines for older patients (23.7\% of practitioners) accounted for 76.7\% of all OMEs dispensed and comprised 93.0\% of the top 1\% of practitioners by opioid volume dispensed. The cluster prescribing analgesics for younger patients with high rates of surgery (18.7\% of practitioners) prescribed only 1.6\% of OMEs. The remaining two clusters comprised 21.2\% of prescribers and 20.9\% of OMEs dispensed. Discussion and Conclusion: We observed substantial variation in opioid prescribing among practitioners, clustered around four general patterns. We did not assess appropriateness but some prescribing patterns are concerning. Our findings provide insights for targeted interventions to curb potentially harmful practices.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Australia introduced tamper-resistant controlled-release (CR) oxycodone in April 2014. We quantified the impact of the reformulation on dispensing, switching and poisonings. METHODS: We performed interrupted time-series analyses using population-representative national dispensing data from 2012 to 2016. We measured dispensing of oxycodone CR ({$\geq$} 10 mg), discontinuation of use of strong opioids and switching to other strong opioids after the reformulation compared with a historical control period. Similarly, we compared calls about intentional opioid poisoning using data from a regional poisons information centre. RESULTS: After the reformulation, dispensing decreased for 10--30 mg (total level shift -11.1\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI], -17.2\% to -4.6\%) and 40--80 mg oxycodone CR (total level shift -31.5\%, 95\% CI -37.5\% to -24.9\%) in participants less than 65 years of age but was unchanged in people 65 years of age or older. Compared with the previous year, discontinuation of use of strong opioids did not increase (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95\% CI 0.91 to 1.00), but switching to oxycodone/naloxone did increase (adjusted HR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.32 to 1.79). Switching to morphine varied by age (p {$<$} 0.001), and the greatest increase was in participants less than 45 years of age (adjusted HR 4.33, 95\% CI 2.13 to 8.80). Participants switching after the reformulation were more likely to be dispensed a tablet strength of 40 mg or more (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.40, 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.79). Calls for intentional poisoning that involved oxycodone taken orally increased immediately after the reformulation (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.31, 95\% CI 1.05--1.64), but there was no change for injected oxycodone. INTERPRETATION: The reformulation had a greater impact on opioid access patterns of people less than 65 years of age who were using higher strengths of oxycodone CR. This group has been identified as having an increased risk of problematic opioid use and warrants closer monitoring in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We compared statin adherence in individuals initiating combined amlodipine/atorvastatin therapy as a fixed-dose (FDC) or free combination and identified subgroups benefiting most from FDCs. METHODS: We used a 10\% sample of Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dispensing data (2005-2015) to identify individuals initiating amlodipine and atorvastatin as an FDC (n~=~3996) or free combination (n~=~5434), with or without prior statin dispensing. We measured the proportion of days covered in each 30-day period over 24~months and classified patterns of statin adherence using group-based trajectory models. We identified predictors of adherence trajectories using logistic regression. RESULTS: The median age was 71~years, and 53\% were female. We identified 4 patterns of statin adherence: near-perfect adherence (n~=~5383), good adherence (n~=~1893), declining adherence (n~=~1247), and early nonadherence (n~=~907). Compared with the free combination, FDC initiators were more likely to have near-perfect adherence if they were previously statin adherent irrespective of amlodipine dose (amlodipine 5~mg: OR~=~1.61, 95\% CI 1.38-1.87; amlodipine 10~mg: OR~=~2.39, 95\% CI 1.63-3.51) or they were previously statin nonadherent and initiated on the 5\,mg amlodipine dose (OR~=~1.87, 95\% CI 1.50-2.32). Statin-na{\"i}ve individuals initiating on the FDC with 10\,mg amlodipine were less likely to have near-perfect adherence (OR~=~0.60, 95\% CI 0.41-0.88) and more likely to have early nonadherence (OR~=~1.73, 95\% CI 1.17-2.55). CONCLUSIONS: The amlodipine/atorvastatin FDC was associated with greater statin adherence among prevalent statin users, and individuals who initiated on lower amlodipine doses. The FDCs did not improve adherence in statin-na{\"i}ve individuals and in some cases resulted in poorer adherence.},

  abstract = {The case-control design is widely used in retrospective database studies, often leading to spectacular findings. However, results of these studies often cannot be replicated, and the advantage of this design over others is questionable. To demonstrate the shortcomings of applications of this design, we replicate two published case-control studies. The first investigates isotretinoin and ulcerative colitis using a simple case-control design. The second focuses on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and acute pancreatitis, using a nested case-control design. We include large sets of negative control exposures (where the true odds ratio is believed to be 1) in both studies. Both replication studies produce effect size estimates consistent with the original studies, but also generate estimates for the negative control exposures showing substantial residual bias. In contrast, applying a self-controlled design to answer the same questions using the same data reveals far less bias. Although the case-control design in general is not at fault, its application in retrospective database studies, where all exposure and covariate data for the entire cohort are available, is unnecessary, as other alternatives such as cohort and self-controlled designs are available. Moreover, by focusing on cases and controls it opens the door to inappropriate comparisons between exposure groups, leading to confounding for which the design has few options to adjust for. We argue that this design should no longer be used in these types of data. At the very least, negative control exposures should be used to prove that the concerns raised here do not apply.},

  abstract = {Abstract Graphical representation of statistical results is often used to assist readers in the interpretation of the findings. This is especially true for survival analysis where there is an interest in explaining the patterns of survival over time for specific covariates. For fixed categorical covariates, such as a group membership indicator, Kaplan-Meier estimates (1958) can be used to display the curves. For time-dependent covariates this method may not be adequate. Simon and Makuch (1984) proposed a technique that evaluates the covariate status of the individuals remaining at risk at each event time. The method takes into account the change in an individual's covariate status over time. The survival computations are the same as the Kaplan-Meier method, in that the conditional survival estimates are the function of the ratio of the number of events to the number at risk at each event time. The difference between the two methods is that the individuals at risk within each level defined by the covariate is not fixed at time 0 in the Simon and Makuch method as it is with the Kaplan-Meier method. Examples of how the two methods can differ for time dependent covariates in Cox proportional hazards regression analysis are presented. Copyright ? 2002 Whurr Publishers Ltd.},

  abstract = {Confidence intervals (CIs) and the reported predictive ability of statistical models may be misleading if one ignores uncertainty in the model selection procedure. When analyzing time-to-event data using Cox regression, one typically checks the proportional hazards (PH) assumption and subsequently alters the model to address any violations. Such an examination and correction constitute a model selection procedure, and, if not accounted for, could result in misleading CI. With the bootstrap, I study the impact of checking the PH assumption using (1) data to predict AIDS-free survival among HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy and (2) simulated data. In the HIV study, due to non-PH, a Cox model was stratified on age quintiles. Interestingly, bootstrap CIs that ignored the PH check (always stratified on age quintiles) were wider than those which accounted for the PH check (on each bootstrap replication PH was tested and corrected through stratification only if violated). Simulations demonstrated that such a phenomenon is not an anomaly, although on average CIs widen when accounting for the PH check. In most simulation scenarios, coverage probabilities adjusting and not adjusting for the PH check were similar. However, when data were generated under a minor PH violation, the 95 per cent bootstrap CI ignoring the PH check had a coverage of 0.77 as opposed to 0.95 for CI accounting for the PH check. The impact of checking the PH assumption is greatest when the p-value of the test for PH is close to the test's chosen Type I error probability. Copyright {\copyright} 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Previous studies have sometimes reported 4 prototypic courses: (a) a consistently "low" group, (b) an "increase" group, (c) a "decrease" group, and (d) a consistently "high" group. Although not always recovered, these trajectories are often found, despite these studies varying in the ages of the samples studied and the duration of the observation periods employed. Here, the authors examined the consistency with which these longitudinal patterns of heavy drinking were recovered in a series of latent class growth analyses that systematically varied the age of the sample at baseline, the duration of observation, and the number and frequency of measurement occasions. Data were drawn from a 4-year, 8-wave panel study of college student drinking (N = 3,720). Despite some variability across analyses, there was a strong tendency for these prototypes to emerge regardless of the participants' age at baseline and the duration of observation. These findings highlight potential problems with commonly employed trajectory-based approaches and the need to not over-reify these constructs.},

A simple quantitative methaemoglobinemia bedside test was developed so that treatment could be titrated according to the methaemoglobin level. Objective: To determine whether the new method influenced patient management and changed the case fatality of propanil self-poisoning. Method: The bedside test (using an inexpensive validated colour chart) was introduced in three hospitals (Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Galle) in Sri Lanka from 2008. Junior ward staff were given a brief training on how to use the chart for quantitative estimation of methaemoglobin in patients with propanil poisoning and utilize the results in the context of the national treatment guidelines for propanil poisoning. It was taught that the bedside test should be done repeatedly from admission until it showed consistently low values of methaemoglobin. Treatment with the antidote methylene blue was suggested for patients whose methaemoglobin was greater than 20\%. Limited clinical data on poisoning have been prospectively collected from these hospitals from 2003. The case-fatality and management before and after the change were compared with data up to December 2014. Results: The case-fatality decreased from (38/401) 9.5\% to (8/262) 3.1\% [difference: -6.4\%, 95\% CI: -10 to -3]. Methylene blue use increased from under 10\% of patients before to 55\% of patients after the intervention. More patients received repeat doses and infusions, and few received ascorbic acid and exchange transfusion. Conclusion: The simple bedside test for methaemoglobinemia was readily adopted into routine practice and led to large changes in management. A substantial reduction in mortality from propanil poisoning occurred after this intervention.}

Limited clinical data on poisoning have been prospectively collected from these hospitals from 2003. The case-fatality and management before and after the change were compared with data up to December 2014.Results: The case-fatality decreased from (38/401) 9.5\% to (8/262) 3.1\% [difference: -6.4\%, 95\% CI: -10 to -3]. Methylene blue use increased from under 10\% of patients before to 55\% of patients after the intervention. More patients received repeat doses and infusions, and few received ascorbic acid and exchange transfusion.Conclusion: The simple bedside test for methaemoglobinemia was readily adopted into routine practice and led to large changes in management. A substantial reduction in mortality from propanil poisoning occurred after this intervention.},

  abstract = {Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for developing and testing theories by way of causal explanation, prediction, and description. In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

  abstract = {Purpose To examine the associations between gender role discrepancy (non-conformity to socially prescribed masculine gender role norms) and discrepancy stress (distress arising from this discrepancy) on COVID-19 prevention behaviors among men, and the potential moderating effects of race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and income on these relationships. Design A national online survey was conducted between May and June 2021. Setting The United States. Subjects 749 adult men residing in the United States. Measures A scale measured gender role discrepancy and discrepancy stress. COVID-19 prevention outcomes were constructed and included self-reported vaccination status/intentions, social distancing, mask-wearing, and hand-sanitizing. Analysis Multivariate generalized linear models were performed in SPSS. Results Gender role discrepancy associated with greater odds of vaccination (AOR = 1.35, 95\% CI = 1.02-1.78, P = .04), while discrepancy stress associated with lower odds of vaccination (AOR = .48, 95\% CI = .35-.68, P {$<$} 0. 001) and mask-wearing (AOR = .54, 95\% CI = .37-.79, P = .001) for men overall. Discrepancy stress's negative effect on specific COVID-19 prevention behaviors was only apparent or was amplified for men in lower income brackets (vaccination, social distancing, mask-wearing), racial/ethnic minority men (vaccination), and sexual minority men (social distancing). Conclusion This study demonstrates that gender role discrepancy stress negatively affects men's engagement in COVID-19 prevention, particularly for men in marginalized populations.},

  abstract = {Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is common, impairing, and undertreated. Although many patients with GAD seek complementary and alternative interventions, including yoga, data supporting yoga's efficacy or how it compares to first-line treatments are lacking.To assess whether yoga (Kundalini yoga) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for GAD are each more effective than a control condition (stress education) and whether yoga is noninferior to CBT for the treatment of GAD.For this randomized, 3-arm, controlled, single-blind (masked independent raters) clinical trial, participants were recruited from 2 specialty academic centers starting December 1, 2013, with assessment ending October 25, 2019. Primary analyses, completed by February 12, 2020, included superiority testing of Kundalini yoga and CBT vs stress education and noninferiority testing of Kundalini yoga vs CBT.Participants were randomized to Kundalini yoga (n\,=\,93), CBT for GAD (n\,=\,90), or stress education (n\,=\,43), which were each delivered to groups of 4 to 6 participants by 2 instructors during twelve 120-minute sessions with 20 minutes of daily homework.The primary intention-to-treat outcome was acute GAD response (Clinical Global Impression--Improvement Scale score of much or very much improved) after 12 weeks as assessed by trained independent raters.Of 538 participants who provided consent and were evaluated, 226 (mean [SD] age, 33.4 [13.5] years; 158 [69.9\%] female) with a primary diagnosis of GAD were included in the trial. A total of 155 participants (68.6\%) completed the posttreatment assessment. Completion rates did not differ (Kundalini yoga, 60 [64.5\%]; CBT, 67 [74.4\%]; and stress education, 28 [65.1\%]: {$\chi$}2\,=\,2.39, df\,=\,2, P\,=\,.30). Response rates were higher in the Kundalini yoga group (54.2\%) than in the stress education group (33.\%) (odds ratio [OR], 2.46 [95\% CI, 1.12-5.42]; P\,=\,.03; number needed to treat, 4.59 [95\% CI, 2.52-46.19]) and in the CBT group (70.8\%) compared with the stress education group (33.0\%) (OR, 5.00 [95\% CI, 2.12-11.82]; P\,\&lt;\,.001; number needed to treat, 2.62 [95\% CI, 1.91-5.68]). However, the noninferiority test did not find Kundalini yoga to be as effective as CBT (difference, 16.6\%; P\,=\,.42 for noninferiority).In this trial, Kundalini yoga was efficacious for GAD, but the results support CBT remaining first-line treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01912287},

Twenty worksites were randomized separately for each intervention using a two-by-two factorial design. All participants underwent a health risk appraisal and measurements were made at baseline and at 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: The overall response rate for the baseline survey was 73\% with 61\% attending the health risk appraisal. The sample was predominantly male, English-speaking, married, blue-collar workers. Overall, 12\% reported unsafe alcohol consumption, 26\% were current smokers, 44\% were physically inactive, 74\% ate at most one piece of fruit per day, and 26\% ate at most one serving of vegetables per day. Intervention and control conditions were similar at baseline for the primary outcomes, except that a higher proportion of the sociobehavioral intervention condition was more physically active (59\%) than the corresponding control condition (53\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study will permit the rigorous evaluation of the efficacy of sociobehavioral and environ mental intervention approaches to workplace health promotion.

  abstract = {Background: While resilience has been defined as resistance to illness, adaptation, and thriving, the ability to bounce back or recover from stress is closest to its original meaning. Previous resilience measures assess resources that may promote resilience rather than recovery, resistance, adaptation, or thriving. Purpose: To test a new brief resilience scale. Method: The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. Its psychometric characteristics were examined in four samples, including two student samples and samples with cardiac and chronic pain patients. Results: The BRS was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in BRS scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without fibromyalgia. Conclusion: The BRS is a reliable means of assessing resilience as the ability to bounce back or recover from stress and may provide unique and important information about people coping with health-related stressors.},

DESIGN AND SETTING: A descriptive summary of operating the media doctor website between 1 February and 1 September 2004. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consensus scores for 10 assessment criteria for the medical intervention described in the article (novelty, availability in Australia, alternative treatment options given, evidence of "disease mongering", objective supportive evidence given, quantification of benefits, coverage of harms, coverage of costs, independent sources of information, and excessive reliance on a press release); cumulative article rating scores for major media outlets. RESULTS: 104 news articles were featured on media doctor in the study period. Both online and print media scored poorly, although the print media were superior: mean total scores 56.1\% satisfactory for print and 40.1\% for online; percentage points difference 15.9 (95\% CI, 8.3-23.6). The greatest differences were seen for the use of independent information sources, quantification of benefits and coverage of potential harms. CONCLUSIONS: Australian lay news reporting of medical advances, particularly by the online news services, is poor. This might improve if journals and researchers became more active in communicating with the press and the public.},

This study estimates rates of ARCs across all communities in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, using routinely collected police data; investigates whether there are differences between communities; and identifies individual and community characteristics that are significantly associated with higher rates of ARCs. Short summary: This study analysed routinely collected police data in New South Wales, Australia, to identify individual and community characteristics associated with alcohol-related crimes. Young people, Aboriginal Australians, socio-economically disadvantaged communities, remote and regional communities and communities with higher per capita rate of on-venue liquor licenses are at risk of alcohol-related crimes. Methods: Age standardized rates of ARCs were calculated. A multi-level Poisson regression analysis was conducted to investigate the individual and community factors that were statistically significantly associated with higher rates of ARC, separately for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Results: Rates of ARCs were statistically significantly higher for Aboriginal Australians, young people (aged 13-37 years) and on weekends. ARCs varied significantly across communities, and were significantly higher in remote or regional communities, in communities with a higher per capita rate of on-venue licences, and for socio-economically disadvantaged communities for non- Aboriginal Australians, but not for Aboriginal females. Conclusion: This analysis shows that the impact of national-level and jurisdictional-level legislation and policies is uneven across communities and defined populations, leaving young people, socio-economically disadvantaged communities and Aboriginal Australians at increased risk of ARCs. To more equitably reduce the exposure of all Australians to ARC, mechanisms that effectively engage vulnerable communities and defined populations, need to be developed in consultation with them, implemented and evaluated.}

  abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to study measurement properties of the Dutch Language Version of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS-DLV) in blue and white collar workers employed at multiple companies and to compare the validity and factor structure to other language versions. Methods Workers (n~=~1023) were assessed during a cross-sectional health surveillance. Construct validity was tested with exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) and hypothesis testing. Reliability was tested with Cronbach's alpha. Results A two-factor structure of the BRS-DLV had good model fit in both EFA and CFA, which could be explained by difficulties of workers with reversed order items. After excluding these inconsistent answering patterns, a one-factor structure showed good model fit resembling the original BRS ({$\chi$}2~=~16.5; CFI \& TLI~=~0.99; SRMR~=~0.02;RMSEA~=~0.04). Internal consistency is sufficient (Cronbach's {$\alpha~$}=~0.78). All five hypotheses were confirmed, suggesting construct validity. Conclusions Reliability of the BRS-DLV is sufficient and there is evidence of construct validity. Inconsistent answering, however, caused problems in interpretation and factor structure of the BRS-DLV. This can be easily detected and handled because item 2, 4 and 6 are in reversed order. Other language versions differ in factor structure, most likely because systematic errors are not corrected for. To collect valid data, it is advised to be aware of inconsistent answering of respondents.},

Conclusions: The difference in nutrition knowledge between women with and without EDs is unlikely to be of clinical importance. The findings may reflect today's ubiquitous availability of nutrition information. {\copyright} 2009 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.}

  abstract = {This paper aims to introduce multilevel logistic regression analysis in a simple and practical way. First, we introduce the basic principles of logistic regression analysis (conditional probability, logit transformation, odds ratio). Second, we discuss the two fundamental implications of running this kind of analysis with a nested data structure: In multilevel logistic regression, the odds that the outcome variable equals one (rather than zero) may vary from one cluster to another (i.e. the intercept may vary) and the effect of a lower-level variable may also vary from one cluster to another (i.e. the slope may vary). Third and finally, we provide a simplified three-step ``turnkey'' procedure for multilevel logistic regression modeling: ~ -Preliminary phase: Cluster- or grand-mean centering variables -Step \#1: Running an empty model and calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) -Step \#2: Running a constrained and an augmented intermediate model and performing a likelihood ratio test to determine whether considering the cluster-based variation of the effect of the lower-level variable improves the model fit -Step \#3 Running a final model and interpreting the odds ratio and confidence intervals to determine whether data support your hypothesis ~ Command syntax for Stata, R, Mplus, and SPSS are included. These steps will be applied to a study on Justin Bieber, because everybody likes Justin Bieber.1},

Although these outcomes are frequently analysed with a linear mixed model, or a Poisson mixed model, a two-part mixed model would be better in analysing outcome variables with an excess of zeros. Therefore, objective of this paper was to introduce the relatively `new' method of two-part joint regression modelling in longitudinal data analysis for outcome variables with an excess of zeros, and to compare the performance of this method to current approaches.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To assess the performance of a proxy for estrogen receptor (ER) status in breast cancer patients using pharmaceutical claims data. Method: We derived our proxy using 167 patients. ER+ patients had evidence of at least one Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) dispensing record for hormone therapy during the PBS observation period, irrespective of diagnosis date. Patients were classified as ER- in the absence of dispensing records for hormone therapy during the period. We validated the proxy against our gold standard, ER status from pathology reports or medical records. We assessed the proxy's performance using three PBS dispensing histories of 4.5 years (1/1/2006-30/6/2010), 2 years (1/7/2008-30/6/2010), and 1 year (1/7/2008-30/6/2010). Results: 62\% of our cohort was {$>$}50 years, 52\% had stage III/IV breast cancer and 41\% were being treated with a trastuzumab-based protocol when recruited. Most women (46\%) were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 and 23\% before 2006.Sensitivity and specificity were high for the complete PBS observation period (92.8\%, 95\%CI: 86.4 -- 96.4\%; 95.2\%: 82.6 -- 99.2\%) and remained high with two years of dispensing history (91.2\%: 84.4 -- 95.3\%; 95.2\%: 82.6 -- 99.2\%). Sensitivity decreased (83.2\%: 75.2 -- 89.1\%) but specificity remained high (95.2\%: 82.6 -- 99.2\%) using one year of dispensing history. Conclusion: Our proxy is robust, even with one year of dispensing data. We recommend deriving the proxy using at least two years of pharmaceutical claims. Our proxy can be used to accurately infer ER status in secondary health data and determine the effectiveness of breast cancer treatments in real-world outcome studies.},

ER+ patients had evidence of at least one dispensing record for hormone therapy during the lookback period, irrespective of diagnosis date and ER- had no dispensing records for hormone therapy during the period. We validated the proxy against our gold standard, ER status from pathology reports or medical records. We assessed the proxy's performance using three lookback periods: 4.5 years, 2 years, 1 year. RESULTS: More than half of our cohort (62\%) were {$>$}50 years, 54\% had stage III/IV breast cancer at recruitment, (46\%) were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 and 23\% were diagnosed before 2006. Sensitivity and specificity were high for the 4.5 year lookback period (93\%, 95\% CI: 86-96\%; and 95\%: 83-99\%), respectively) and remained high for the 2-year lookback period (91\%: 84-95\%; and 95\%: 83-99\%). Sensitivity decreased (83\%: 75.2-89\%) but specificity remained high (95\%: 83-99\%) using the 1-year lookback period and the period is long enough to allow sufficient time for hormone therapy to be dispensed.

Sensitivity and specificity were high for the 4.5 year lookback period (93\%, 95\% CI: 86-96\%; and 95\%: 83-99\%), respectively) and remained high for the 2-year lookback period (91\%: 84-95\%; and 95\%: 83-99\%). Sensitivity decreased (83\%: 75.2-89\%) but specificity remained high (95\%: 83-99\%) using the 1-year lookback period and the period is long enough to allow sufficient time for hormone therapy to be dispensed. Conclusion Our proxy accurately infers ER status in studies of breast cancer treatment based on secondary health data. The proxy is most robust with a minimum lookback period of 2 years.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine statin discontinuation rates in a cohort of elderly Australians with newly diagnosed cancer using population-based secondary health data. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: New South Wales, the largest jurisdiction in Australia. The Pharmaceutical Benefits and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemes are national programmes subsidising prescription drugs to the Australian population and Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs clients. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort comprised 1731 cancer patients aged {$\geq$}65 years with evidence of statin use in the 90 days prior to diagnosis. They were matched to 3462 non-cancer patients prescribed statins in the same period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The authors compared statin discontinuation rates up to 4 years post-diagnosis and examined the factors associated with statin discontinuation. RESULTS: The proportion of cancer patients discontinuing statin therapy at 4 years (27\%) was comparable to the comparison cohort; however, significantly higher proportions of the cancer cohort discontinued statins than the comparison cohort at 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up (9.7\% vs 7.4\% at 12 months, respectively). More than 30\% of cancer patients who died were dispensed statins within 30 days of death. Discontinuation of statin therapy in cancer patients was associated with regionalised and distant disease spread at diagnosis (p{$<$}0.001), older age (p=0.006), upper gastrointestinal organs and liver cancer (aHR 2.95, 95\% CI 1.92 to 4.53) and cancer of the lung, bronchus and trachea (aHR 1.99, 95\% CI 1.32 to 3.00) and poorer survival. CONCLUSIONS: Medications should be rationalised at the time of a cancer diagnosis, especially in the setting of a poor prognosis. At least for some patients in our cohort, statin therapy may be inappropriately continued which adds unnecessarily to therapeutic burden.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models provide risk estimates for the presence of disease (diagnosis) or an event in the future course of disease (prognosis) for individual patients. Although publications that present and evaluate such models are becoming more frequent, the methodology is often suboptimal. We propose that seven steps should be considered in developing prediction models: (i) consideration of the research question and initial data inspection; (ii) coding of predictors; (iii) model specification; (iv) model estimation; (v) evaluation of model performance; (vi) internal validation; and (vii) model presentation. The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. This illustrates the usefulness of the proposed framework to strengthen the methodological rigour and quality for prediction models in cardiovascular research.},

  abstract = {The second edition of this volume provides insight and practical illustrations on how modern statistical concepts and regression methods can be applied in medical prediction problems, including diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Many advances have been made in statistical approaches towards outcome prediction, but a sensible strategy is needed for model development, validation, and updating, such that prediction models can better support medical practice.There is an increasing need for personalized evidence-based medicine that uses an individualized approach to medical decision-making. In this Big Data era, there is expanded access to large volumes of routinely collected data and an increased number of applications for prediction models, such as targeted early detection of disease and individualized approaches to diagnostic testing and treatment. Clinical Prediction Models presents a practical checklist that needs to be considered for development of a valid prediction model. Steps include preliminary considerations such as dealing with missing values; coding of predictors; selection of main effects and interactions for a multivariable model; estimation of model parameters with shrinkage methods and incorporation of external data; evaluation of performance and usefulness; internal validation; and presentation formatting. The text also addresses common issues that make prediction models suboptimal, such as small sample sizes, exaggerated claims, and poor generalizability. The text is primarily intended for clinical epidemiologists and biostatisticians. Including many case studies and publicly available R code and data sets, the book is also appropriate as a textbook for a graduate course on predictive modeling in diagnosis and prognosis. While practical in nature, the book also provides a philosophical perspective on data analysis in medicine that goes beyond predictive modeling. Updates to this new and expanded edition include:{$\bullet$} A discussion of Big Data and its implications for the design of prediction models{$\bullet$} Machine learning issues{$\bullet$} More simulations with missing `y' values{$\bullet$} Extended discussion on between-cohort heterogeneity{$\bullet$} Description of ShinyApp{$\bullet$} Updated LASSO illustration{$\bullet$} New case studies},

Objective: The aim of this cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to test the effectiveness of a contact intervention for parents having supervised contact with children in long-term OOHC. Participants: 183 study children in 15 clusters (OOHC services) and their parent(s) were randomized to the intervention (8 clusters, 100 children) and control groups (7 clusters, 83 children) in three Australian jurisdictions. Setting: The manualized intervention consisted of increasing the preparation and support provided by caseworkers to parents before and after their contact visits. Method: Interviews were conducted with carers, parents and caseworkers of the study children at baseline and nine months post-randomization. Interviews included standardized assessment tools measuring child and adult wellbeing and relationships, carer and caseworker ability to support contact, and contact visit cancellations by the parent. Results: Compared with controls, the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses showed that fewer visits were cancelled by parents in the intervention group at follow-up (-10.27; 95 \% CI: -17.04 to -3.50, p = .006). In addition, per-protocol (PP) analyses showed higher caseworker receptivity to contact (6.03; 95 \% CI: 0.04--12.03, p = .04), and higher parent satisfaction with contact (7.41; 95 \% CI: 0.70--14.11, p = .03) in the intervention group at follow-up. Conclusions: While the intervention did not have an effect on child wellbeing, as measured by the SDQ, the trial reports significant positive findings and demonstrates the benefits of the kC kContact intervention in providing support to parents to attend contact visits. The findings of the current study provide an important contribution to knowledge in an area where few RCTs have been completed, notwithstanding the null findings.}

In addition, per-protocol (PP) analyses showed higher caseworker receptivity to contact (6.03; 95 \% CI: 0.04--12.03, p = .04), and higher parent satisfaction with contact (7.41; 95 \% CI: 0.70--14.11, p = .03) in the intervention group at follow-up. Conclusions While the intervention did not have an effect on child wellbeing, as measured by the SDQ, the trial reports significant positive findings and demonstrates the benefits of the kC kContact intervention in providing support to parents to attend contact visits. The findings of the current study provide an important contribution to knowledge in an area where few RCTs have been completed, notwithstanding the null findings.},

Settings Any healthcare setting servicing pregnant women, including any country globally. Participants Pregnant women of any social, ethnic or geographical background who smoke. Methods We searched Embase, Medline, Web Of Science, Google Scholar, PsychINFO, CINAHL and PubMed between 2007 and November 2021. We included published original intervention studies in English with comparators (usual care or placebo). Two independent assessors screened and abstracted data. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis, assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane Tool and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to assess the quality of evidence. Results We identified 57 studies and included 54 in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies assessed DH (n=3961), 6 BF (n=1643), 32 NoMC (n=60 251), 1 assessed NoMC with BF (n=1120) and 2 NoMC with DH interventions (n=2107). DH interventions had moderate certainty evidence to achieve continuous abstinence (CA) at late pregnancy (4 studies; 2049 women; RR=1.98, 95\% CI 1.08 to 3.64, p=0.03) and low certainty evidence to achieve point prevalence abstinence (PPA) postpartum (5 studies; 2238 women; RR=1.46, 95\% CI 1.05 to 2.02, p=0.02). NoMC interventions had moderate certainty evidence to achieve PPA in late pregnancy (15 studies; 16 234 women; RR=1.54, 95\% CI 1.16 to 2.06, p{$<$}0.01) and low certainty evidence to achieve PPA postpartum (13 studies; 5466 women; RR=1.79, 95\% CI 1.14 to 2.83, p=0.01). Both DH and BF interventions did not achieve PPA at late pregnancy, nor NoMC interventions achieve CA postpartum. The certainty was reduced due to risk of bias, heterogeneity, inconsistency and/or imprecision. Conclusion NoMC interventions can assist pregnant smokers achieve PPA and DH interventions achieve CA in late pregnancy. These interventions may achieve other outcomes.}

  abstract = {BackgroundThe change in estimate is a popular approach for selecting confounders in epidemiology. It is recommended in epidemiologic textbooks and articles over significance test of coefficients, but concerns have been raised concerning its validity. Few simulation studies have been conducted to investigate its performance.MethodsAn extensive simulation study was realized to compare different implementations of the change in estimate method. The implementations were also compared when estimating the association of body mass index with diastolic blood pressure in the PROspective Qu{\'e}bec Study on Work and Health.ResultsAll methods were susceptible to introduce important bias and to produce confidence intervals that included the true effect much less often than expected in at least some scenarios. Overall mixed results were obtained regarding the accuracy of estimators, as measured by the mean squared error. No implementation adequately differentiated confounders from non-confounders. In the real data analysis, none of the implementation decreased the estimated standard error.ConclusionBased on these results, it is questionable whether change in estimate methods are beneficial in general, considering their low ability to improve the precision of estimates without introducing bias and inability to yield valid confidence intervals or to identify true confounders.},

However, the research evidence on contact is weak and provides little guidance on how to manage contact and when it is beneficial or potentially harmful.

A small number of studies have been identified where interventions which were therapeutic, child-focused and with clear goals, particularly aimed at preparing and supporting parents, showed some promising results. This trial aims to build on the existing evidence by trialling an enhanced model of contact in multiple sites in Australia. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial of an enhanced contact intervention with children in long-term care who are having supervised contact with their parents. Intervention sites will implement the kContact intervention that increases the preparation and support provided to parents in relation to contact. Baseline and follow-up interviews are being conducted with parents, carers and agency workers at intervention and control sites. Follow-ups interviews will assess whether there has been an increase in children's emotional safety and a reduction in distress in response to contact visits with their parents (the primary outcome variable as measured using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire), improved relationships between children and their parents, improved parental ability to support contact, and fewer contact visits cancelled. DISCUSSION: By increasing the evidence base in this area, the study aims to better guide the management and supervision of contact visits in the out-of-home care context and improve outcomes for the children and their families.

  abstract = {Pilot studies for phase III trials - which are comparative randomized trials designed to provide preliminary evidence on the clinical efficacy of a drug or intervention - are routinely performed in many clinical areas. Also commonly know as "feasibility" or "vanguard" studies, they are designed to assess the safety of treatment or interventions; to assess recruitment potential; to assess the feasibility of international collaboration or coordination for multicentre trials; to increase clinical experience with the study medication or intervention for the phase III trials. They are the best way to assess feasibility of a large, expensive full-scale study, and in fact are an almost essential pre-requisite. Conducting a pilot prior to the main study can enhance the likelihood of success of the main study and potentially help to avoid doomed main studies. The objective of this paper is to provide a detailed examination of the key aspects of pilot studies for phase III trials including: 1) the general reasons for conducting a pilot study; 2) the relationships between pilot studies, proof-of-concept studies, and adaptive designs; 3) the challenges of and misconceptions about pilot studies; 4) the criteria for evaluating the success of a pilot study; 5) frequently asked questions about pilot studies; 7) some ethical aspects related to pilot studies; and 8) some suggestions on how to report the results of pilot investigations using the CONSORT format.},

This study aims to quantify body mass index (BMI) trajectories among Indigenous Australian children aged 3-6 and 6-9 years and to identify factors associated with the development of overweight/obesity. Methods: Three-year BMI change was examined in up to 1,157 children in the national Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children. BMI trajectories among children with normal baseline BMI (n = 907/1,157) were quantified using growth curve models. Results: Baseline prevalences of overweight/obesity were 12.1\% and 25.4\% among children of mean age 3 and 6 years, respectively. Of children with normal baseline BMI, 31.9\% had overweight/obesity 3 years later; BMI increased more rapidly for younger versus older (difference: 0.59 kg/m2/year; 95\% CI: 0.50-0.69), female versus male (difference: 0.15 kg/m2/year; 95\% CI: 0.07-0.23), and Torres Strait Islander versus Aboriginal (difference: 0.36 kg/m2/year; 95\% CI: 0.17-0.55) children. Results were consistent with less rapid rates of BMI increase for children with lower sugar-sweetened beverage (including fruit juice) and high-fat food consumption. Children's BMI was lower in more disadvantaged areas. Conclusions: Overweight/obesity is common, and increases rapidly, in early childhood. Interventions are required to reduce the overweight/obesity prevalence among Indigenous Australian children in the first 3 years of life and to slow the rapid overweight/obesity onset from age 3 to 9 years.}

  abstract = {Objective: To identify barriers to fruit and vegetable intake for Indigenous Australian children and quantify factors related to these barriers, to help understand why children do not meet recommendations for fruit and vegetable intake. Design: We examined factors related to carer-reported barriers using multilevel Poisson models (robust variance); a key informant focus group guided our interpretation of findings. Setting: Eleven diverse sites across Australia. Subjects: Australian Indigenous children and their carers (N 1230) participating in the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children. Results: Almost half (45 \%; n 555/1230) of carers reported barriers to their children's fruit and vegetable intake. Dislike of fruit and vegetables was the most common barrier, reported by 32.9\% of carers; however, we identified few factors associated with dislike. Carers were more than ten times less likely to report barriers to accessing fruit and vegetables if they lived large cities v. very remote areas. Within urban and inner regional areas, child and carer well-being, financial security, suitable housing and community cohesion promoted access to fruit and vegetables. Conclusions: In this national Indigenous Australian sample, almost half of carers faced barriers to providing their children with a healthy diet. Both remote/outer regional carers and disadvantaged urban/inner regional carers faced problems accessing fruit and vegetables for their children. Where vegetables were accessible, children's dislike was a substantial barrier. Nutrition promotion must address the broader family, community, environmental and cultural contexts that impact nutrition, and should draw on the strengths of Indigenous families and communities.}

  abstract = {Introduction: This cluster-randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the effect of the "Which test is best?"tool on risk-appropriate screening (RAS) and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening uptake. Methods: General practices in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, and a random sub-sample of 460 patients (aged 25-74 years) per practice were invited by post. Clusters were computer randomized independently of the researchers to an online CRC risk calculator with risk-based recommendations versus usual care. Primary and secondary outcomes were RAS and screening uptake via self-reported 5-year screening behaviour after 12 months follow-up. The usual care group (UCG) also self-reported 5-year CRC screening behaviour at 12 month post-randomization. Results: Fifty-six practices were randomized (27 to the intervention and 29 to the control, 55 practices participated) with 818 intervention and 677 controls completing the primary outcome measure. The intervention significantly increased RAS in high-risk participants compared with UCG (80.0\% vs. 64.0\%, respectively; OR = 3.14, 95\% CI: 1.25-7.96) but not in average-risk (44.9\% vs. 49.5\%, respectively; OR = 0.97, 95\% CI: 0.99-1.12) or moderate-risk individuals (67.9\% vs. 81.1\%, respectively; OR = 0.40, 95\% CI: 0.12-1.33). Faecal occult blood testing uptake over 12 months was increased compared with the UCG (24.9\% vs. 15.1\%; adjusted OR = 1.66, 95\% CI: 1.24-2.22), and there was a non-significant increase in colonoscopies during the same period (16.6\% vs. 12.2\%; adjusted OR = 1.42, 95\% CI: 0.97-2.08). Conclusion: An online CRC risk calculator with risk-based screening recommendations increased RAS in high-risk participants and improved screening uptake overall within a 12-month follow-up period. Such tools may be useful for facilitating the uptake of risk-based screening guidelines.}

Students expressed negative attitudes and concerns related to R at the beginning of the course, but most developed more positive attitudes after engaging with course materials, regardless of demographic characteristics or prior programming experience. Analysis of a subgroup of students revealed that change in attitudes toward R may be linked to students' patterns of engagement over time and students' perceptions of the learning environment.},

  abstract = {Objectives Within epidemiology, a stepped wedge trial design (i.e., a one-way crossover trial in which several arms start the intervention at different time points) is increasingly popular as an alternative to a classical cluster randomized controlled trial. Despite this increasing popularity, there is a huge variation in the methods used to analyze data from a stepped wedge trial design. Study Design and Setting Four linear mixed models were used to analyze data from a stepped wedge trial design on two example data sets. The four methods were chosen because they have been (frequently) used in practice. Method 1 compares all the intervention measurements with the control measurements. Method 2 treats the intervention variable as a time-independent categorical variable comparing the different arms with each other. In method 3, the intervention variable is a time-dependent categorical variable comparing groups with different number of intervention measurements, whereas in method 4, the changes in the outcome variable between subsequent measurements are analyzed. Results Regarding the results in the first example data set, methods 1 and 3 showed a strong positive intervention effect, which disappeared after adjusting for time. Method 2 showed an inverse intervention effect, whereas method 4 did not show a significant effect at all. In the second example data set, the results were the opposite. Both methods 2 and 4 showed significant intervention effects, whereas the other two methods did not. For method 4, the intervention effect attenuated after adjustment for time. Conclusion Different methods to analyze data from a stepped wedge trial design reveal different aspects of a possible intervention effect. The choice of a method partly depends on the type of the intervention and the possible time-dependent effect of the intervention. Furthermore, it is advised to combine the results of the different methods to obtain an interpretable overall result.},

  abstract = {Background: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a common cancer yet little is known about the reliability of incidence data. Methods: We audited 574 CUP (C80.9) diagnoses (median age 81 years) registered by the New South Wales (NSW) Central Cancer Registry (2004-2007) in a cohort of Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs clients. The registry did not clarify diagnoses with notifiers during this period due to interpretation of privacy legislation. For the audit, current registry practice was applied by seeking additional information from CUP notifiers and reclassifying diagnoses as necessary. In addition, clinicopathological characteristics were extracted from notifications. Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test were used to compare the demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of the CUP subgroups. Age/sex-standardised CUP incidence rates and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated, standardised to the 2001 Australian population. Results: 172 (30.0\%) cases were reclassified to a known primary site, mostly cutaneous, and nine (1.6\%) were found to be non-malignant diagnoses. After the audit the age/sex-standardised CUP incidence rates decreased from 26.0 (95\% CI 21.2-30.8) to 15.9 (95\% CI 12.5-19.3) per 100,000 person-years. Of the 393 remaining CUP cases, 202 (51\%) were registered on the basis of a clinical diagnosis (46 by death certificate only) and 191 (49\%) by pathological diagnosis (79 by cytology alone). Compared to cases with a pathological diagnosis, cases with a clinical diagnosis were older (85.6 vs. 82.0 years, p{$<$}. 0.001), and the reported number and location of metastases differed ( p{$<$}. 0.001); metastatic sites were more likely to be unspecified for clinical diagnoses (36.1\% vs. 4.2\%). Conclusions: Cancer registry processes can markedly influence CUP incidence. Future population-based CUP research should take this into account, and consider stratification by basis of diagnosis due to differences in patient and tumour characteristics. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.}

Results: In a fully adjusted model incorporating self-rated overall health and comorbidity, people diagnosed with CUP were more likely to be older (OR 1.05, 95\% CI 1.04--1.07 per year) and more likely to have low educational attainment (OR 1.77, 95\% CI 1.24--2.53) than those diagnosed with metastatic cancer of known primary.

Compared to general cohort population controls, people registered with CUP were more likely to have poor rather than excellent self-rated overall health (OR 6.22, 95\% CI 1.35-28.6), less likely to self-report anxiety (OR 0.28, 95\% CI 0.12 - 0.63), and more likely to have a history of diabetes (OR 1.89, 95\% CI 1.15-3.10) or cancer (OR 1.62, 95\% CI 1.03-2.57). Neither tertiary nor community-based health service use independently predicted CUP risk. Conclusion: Low self-rated health may be a flag for undiagnosed cancer, and an investigation of its clinical utility in primary care appears warranted.}

It is uncertain whether the pathways to diagnosis are different for CUP compared to other cancers. Methods: We performed a population-based nested matched case-control study using linked routinely collected records for Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs clients, 2004-2007. We compared health care consultations, hospitalisations, emergency department visits, and diagnostic procedures in the three months prior and the month of diagnosis for 281 clients registered with a diagnosis of CUP (C809) and 1102 controls randomly selected from clients registered with a first diagnosis of metastatic cancer of known primary. Results: Overall, the median age at cancer diagnosis was 83 years. CUP patients were slightly older and had significantly more comorbidities prior to diagnosis than those with known primary. Compared to known primary, a diagnosis of CUP was significantly more likely after an emergency department visit, less specialist input, fewer invasive diagnostic procedures such as resection or endoscopy, and more non-invasive procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging. There were no differences in primary care or allied health consultations and hospitalisations. Conclusions: This health care pathway suggests delayed recognition of cancer and scope for improvement in the medical management of high-risk individuals presenting to primary care. The pattern of diagnostic investigations reveals under-investigation in some CUP patients but this is likely to reflect recognition of limited treatment options and poor prognosis and is consistent with clinical guidelines.},

A few examples of these candidate learners are: least squares, least angle regression, random forests, and spline regression. Previous articles (van der Laan and Dudoit (2003); van der Laan et al. (2006); Sinisi et al. (2007)) theoretically validated the use of cross validation to select an optimal learner among many candidate learners. Motivated by this use of cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners to build the super learner. This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners. In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions. This approach for construction of a super learner generalizes to any parameter which can be defined as a minimizer of a loss function.},

  abstract = {Selecting an appropriate set of confounders for which to control is critical for reliable causal inference. Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when the~somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.},

  abstract = {Objective: Both public (government-run), and not-for-profit (nongovernment) service providers provide alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment services. Research has rarely studied the structural features of these providers, such as workforce characteristics, procurement arrangements, and funding security. The study reported here sought to document and analyze the differences between these two AOD treatment provider types in Australia. Methods: The study administered an online survey instrument targeted at managers of AOD treatment sites. The survey comprised three sections: (1) the service (e.g., treatment types); (2) workforce (e.g., total number of staff); and (3) funding and procurement arrangements (e.g., contract length). The study completed a total of 207 site surveys. The studied compared government and nongovernment services on structural features that may create a more or less sustainable or vulnerable service (funding arrangements, payment mechanisms, and contract length). Results: Government providers were more likely to provide medically oriented treatment types such as withdrawal management and pharmacotherapy, whereas nongovernment organization (NGO) providers were more likely to offer rehabilitation. Consistent with this, government services were more likely to employ medical professionals and nurses, indicative of a more medically oriented workforce, while NGO services were more likely to employ AOD workers, youth workers, peer workers, and counselors. Our data illustrate that NGO services were more likely to be subject to competitive tendering and to have shorter contract lengths, compared with government services, and overall to be more structurally vulnerable. Conclusion: Despite the reliance on NGOs to provide the majority of specialist care (71\% of all treatment episodes in Australia), these services are more vulnerable than their government counterparts. To ensure that a comprehensive suite of treatment services is available, procurement arrangements that support stability and security in nongovernment service providers and government service providers are essential.}

Although ubiquitous in clinical testing, the null hypothesis significance test can lead to a number of difficulties in interpretation of the results of the statistical evidence.},

  abstract = {Binary logistic regression is one of the most frequently applied statistical approaches for developing clinical prediction models. Developers of such models often rely on an Events Per Variable criterion (EPV), notably EPV {$\geq$}10, to determine the minimal sample size required and the maximum number of candidate predictors that can be examined. We present an extensive simulation study in which we studied the influence of EPV, events fraction, number of candidate predictors, the correlations and distributions of candidate predictor variables, area under the ROC curve, and predictor effects on out-of-sample predictive performance of prediction models. The out-of-sample performance (calibration, discrimination and probability prediction error) of developed prediction models was studied before and after regression shrinkage and variable selection. The results indicate that EPV does not have a strong relation with metrics of predictive performance, and is not an appropriate criterion for (binary) prediction model development studies. We show that out-of-sample predictive performance can better be approximated by considering the number of predictors, the total sample size and the events fraction. We propose that the development of new sample size criteria for prediction models should be based on these three parameters, and provide suggestions for improving sample size determination.},

We introduce six principles: (1) include graphs only if they improve the reader's ability to understand the study findings; (2) think through how a graph might best convey information, do not just select a graph from preselected options on statistical software; (3) do not use graphs to replace reporting key numbers in the text of a paper; (4) graphs should give an immediate visual impression of the data; (5) make it beautiful; and (6) make the labels and legend clear and complete. We present a list of quick ``dos and don'ts'' for both tables and figures. Investigators should feel free to break any of the guidelines if it would result in a beautiful figure or a clear table that communicates data effectively. That said, we believe that the quality of tables and figures in the medical literature would improve if these guidelines were to be followed.

  abstract = {In many randomised trials researchers measure a continuous variable at baseline and again as an outcome assessed at follow up. Baseline measurements are common in trials of chronic conditions where researchers want to see whether a treatment can reduce pre-existing levels of pain, anxiety, hypertension, and the like. Statistical comparisons in such trials can be made in several ways. Comparison of follow up (post-treatment) scores will give a result such as ``at the end of the trial, mean pain scores were 15 mm (95\% confidence interval 10 to 20 mm) lower in the treatment group.'' Alternatively a change score can be calculated by subtracting the follow up score from the baseline score, leading to a statement such as ``pain reductions were 20 mm (16 to 24 mm) greater on treatment than control.'' If the average baseline scores are the same in each group the estimated treatment effect will be the same using these two simple approaches. If the treatment is effective the statistical significance of the treatment effect by the two methods will depend on the correlation between baseline and follow up scores. If the correlation is low using the change score will {\dots}},

  abstract = {Background. Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information and may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. The authors sought a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. Method. The authors describe decision curve analysis, a simple, novel method of evaluating predictive models. They start by assuming that the threshold probability of a disease or event at which a patient would opt for treatment is informative of how the patient weighs the relative harms of a false-positive and a false-negative prediction. This theoretical relationship is then used to derive the net benefit of the model across different threshold probabilities. Plotting net benefit against threshold probability yields the ``decision curve.'' The authors apply the method to models for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion in prostate cancer patients. Decision curve analysis identified the range of threshold probabilities in which a model was of value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models was optimal. Conclusion. Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.},

Methods: A longitudinal, quantitative design was utilized for this ecological study. Changes in individual outcomes over time were compared for SS and CS participants who completed both baseline and 12-month follow-up surveys (N=63). Results: The number of contacts with various types of criminal justice system channels differed significantly between SS and CS participants, decreasing significantly among SS participants and increasing significantly among CS participants. The two groups did not differ on quality-of-life outcomes or social-connectedness measures, with the exception of case management engagement, whereby a greater proportion of SS participants disengaged from this service over time compared with CS participants. At follow-up, significant within-group changes over time emerged, with increased boredom reported among SS participants, whereas CS participants reported improvements in social relationships, with fewer reporting losing their temper. Conclusions: The findings supported the notion that the Housing First approach has the potential to significantly improve the lives of persons who have experienced chronic homelessness, a traditionally marginalized and vulnerable group. Over time, this may result in a reduction in the use of acute services, thereby reducing societal costs. The challenge remains to identify the suitability of particular configurations of housing and support and how service delivery can optimize individual outcomes so positive outcomes are maintained in the longer term.}

The Housing First approach prioritises housing individuals who are homeless in standard lease agreement tenancies as rapidly as possible to lock in the benefits from long-term accommodation, even where the person may not be seen as 'housing ready'. Methods/Design: The longitudinal, mixed methods evaluation utilises both quantitative and qualitative data collected at baseline and 12-month follow-up time points. For the quantitative component, clients of each program were invited to complete client surveys that reported on several factors associated with chronic homelessness and were hypothesised to improve under stable housing, including physical and mental health status and treatment rates, quality of life, substance use patterns, and contact with the health and criminal justice systems. Semi-structured interviews with clients and stakeholders comprised the qualitative component and focused on individual experiences with, and perceptions of, the two programs. In addition, program data on housing stability, rental subsidies and support levels provided to clients by agencies was collected and will be used in conjunction with the client survey data to undertake an economic evaluation of the two programs. Discussion: This study will systematically evaluate the efficacy of a scatter site model (Platform 70) and a congregated model (Common Ground) of the Housing First approach; an examination that has not yet been made either in Australia or internationally. A clear strength of the study is its timing. It was designed and implemented as the programs in question themselves were introduced. Moreover, the programs were introduced when the Australian Government, with State and Territory support, began a more focused, coordinated response to homelessness and funded rapid expansion of innovative homelessness programs across the country, including Common Ground supportive housing developments.}

  abstract = {Multiple imputation can be used as a tool in the process of constructing prediction models in medical and epidemiological studies with missing covariate values. Such models can be used to make predictions for model performance assessment, but the task is made more complicated by the multiple imputation structure. We summarize various predictions constructed from covariates, including multiply imputed covariates, and either the set of imputation-specific prediction model coefficients or the pooled prediction model coefficients. We further describe approaches for using the predictions to assess model performance. We distinguish between ideal model performance and pragmatic model performance, where the former refers to the model's performance in an ideal clinical setting where all individuals have fully observed predictors and the latter refers to the model's performance in a real-world clinical setting where some individuals have missing predictors. The approaches are compared through an extensive simulation study based on the UK700 trial. We determine that measures of ideal model performance can be estimated within imputed datasets and subsequently pooled to give an overall measure of model performance. Alternative methods to evaluate pragmatic model performance are required and we propose constructing predictions either from a second set of covariate imputations which make no use of observed outcomes, or from a set of partial prediction models constructed for each potential observed pattern of covariate. Pragmatic model performance is generally lower than ideal model performance. We focus on model performance within the derivation data, but describe how to extend all the methods to a validation dataset.},

  abstract = {Our work was motivated by small cohort studies on the risk of birth defects in infants born to pregnant women exposed to medications. We controlled for confounding using propensity scores (PS). The extremely rare events setting renders the matching or stratification infeasible. In addition, the PS itself may be formed via different approaches to select confounders from a relatively long list of potential confounders. We carried out simulation experiments to compare different combinations of approaches: IPW or regression adjustment, with 1) including all potential confounders without selection, 2) selection based on univariate association between the candidate variable and the outcome, 3) selection based on change in effects (CIE). The simulation showed that IPW without selection leads to extremely large variances in the estimated odds ratio, which help to explain the empirical data analysis results that we had observed.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a known risk factor for substance use disorder (SUD); however, the potential additive contribution of comorbid ADHD to drug-specific dependence in SUD populations is largely unknown. The current study aimed to assess this association between ADHD symptoms and drug-specific SUD complexity and chronicity. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to a convenience sample of 489 adults receiving SUD treatment at 16 Australian drug and alcohol treatment centres between September 2010 and August 2011. Participants were screened for adult ADHD symptoms using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale. Associations between ADHD screening status and drug-specific SUD complexity and chronicity were assessed using multivariate logistic and modified Poisson regression analysis, controlling for a range of potential confounders. RESULTS: Overall, 215 (44\%) patients screened positive for concurrent adult ADHD and SUD. After Simes' correction, a significant positive association was observed between ADHD screening status and current amphetamine SUD (odds ratio (OR)\,=\,1.85; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-2.36). Patients who screened positive for ADHD were significantly more likely to report SUD\>history for heavy alcohol use (OR\,=\,2.05; 95\% CI: 1.21-3.45) and amphetamine (OR\,=\,1.96; 95\% CI: 1.26-3.06) as well as significantly increased risk of moderate (3-4 years) duration for benzodiazepine and amphetamine SUDs and long ({$\geq$}5 years) duration for alcohol, opiates other than heroin or methadone, and amphetamine SUDs. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide evidence that there is increased drug dependence complexity and chronicity in treatment-seeking SUD patients who screen positively for ADHD, specifically for amphetamine, alcohol, opiates other than heroin or methadone, and benzodiazepines.},

Patients and Methods: Patients with a newly diagnosed colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to the CONNECT intervention or usual care. Intervention-group patients received standardized calls from the centrally based nurse 3 and 10 days and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge from hospital. Unmet supportive care needs, experience of care coordination, unplanned readmissions, emergency department presentations, distress, and quality of life (QOL) were assessed by questionnaire at 1, 3, and 6 months. Results: Of 775 patients treated at 23 public and private hospitals in Australia, 387 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 369 to the control group. There were no significant differences between groups in unmet supportive care needs, but these were consistently low in both groups at both follow-up time points. There were no differences between the groups in emergency department presentations (10.8\% v 13.8\%; P = .2) or unplanned hospital readmissions (8.6\% v 10.5\%; P = .4) at 1 month. By 6 months, 25.6\% of intervention-group patients had reported an unplanned readmission compared with 27.9\% of controls (P = .5). There were no significant differences in experience of care coordination, distress, or QOL between groups at any follow-up time point. Conclusion: This trial failed to demonstrate substantial benefit of a centralized system to provide standardized, telephone follow-up for postoperative patients with colorectal cancer. Future interventions could investigate a more tailored approach.}

Intervention-group patients received standardized calls from the centrally based nurse 3 and 10 days and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge from hospital. Unmet supportive care needs, experience of care coordination, unplanned readmissions, emergency department presentations, distress, and quality of life (QOL) were assessed by questionnaire at 1, 3, and 6 months. Results Of 775 patients treated at 23 public and private hospitals in Australia, 387 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 369 to the control group. There were no significant differences between groups in unmet supportive care needs, but these were consistently low in both groups at both follow-up time points. There were no differences between the groups in emergency department presentations (10.8\% v 13.8\%; P = .2) or unplanned hospital readmissions (8.6\% v 10.5\%; P = .4) at 1 month. By 6 months, 25.6\% of intervention-group patients had reported an unplanned readmission compared with 27.9\% of controls (P = .5). There were no significant differences in experience of care coordination, distress, or QOL between groups at any follow-up time point. Conclusion This trial failed to demonstrate substantial benefit of a centralized system to provide standardized, telephone follow-up for postoperative patients with colorectal cancer. Future interventions could investigate a more tailored approach.}

  abstract = {Introduction: Alcohol is a leading risk factor for death and disease in young people. We compare age-specific characteristics of young people who experience their first (`index') alcohol-related hospitalisation or emergency department (ED) presentation, and whether age at index predicts 12-month rates of readmission. Methods: We used a retrospective linked-data cohort of 10,300 people aged 12--20 years with an index alcohol-related hospital and/or ED record in New South Wales, Australia from 2005 to 2013. Age group (early adolescent [12--14 years], late adolescent [15--17 years], young adult [18--20 years]) and diagnosis fields were used in logistic regression analyses and to calculate incidence rates with adjustment for year of index event, sex, socioeconomic disadvantage and residence remoteness. Results: People who experienced their index event in early adolescence (adjusted relative risk ratio [ARRR] 0.45 [95\% confidence interval 0.39, 0.52]) or late adolescence (ARRR 0.82 [0.74, 0.90]) were less likely to be male compared to young adults. Early adolescents (ARRR 0.60 [0.51, 0.70]) and late adolescents (ARRR 0.84 [0.76, 0.93]) were less likely to have a hospitalisation index event. Early adolescents (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.40 [1.15, 1.71]) and late adolescents (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.16 [1.01, 1.34]) were more likely than young adults to have a subsequent 12-month non-poisoning injury ED presentation. Discussion and Conclusions: We identified preventable hospital events in young people who have previously experienced an alcohol-related ED presentation or hospitalisation, with age-specific characteristics and outcomes that can be used to inform future health policy and service planning.}

  abstract = {Background: We previously reported that increased milk consumption enhances growth and bone mineral accretion in Chinese girls aged 10-12 y. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the effects of milk supplementation on cortical bone accretion and to study the physiologic mechanisms underlying the observed changes in bone. Design: Chinese girls aged 10 y were randomly assigned into calcium-fortified milk (Ca milk), calcium and vitamin D-fortified milk (CaD milk), and control groups according to their schools in a 24-mo school milk intervention trial. Periosteal and medullary diameters of metacarpal bone were measured at baseline and 24 mo in the Ca milk (n = 177), CaD milk (n = 210), and control (n = 219) groups. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), osteocalcin, and deoxypyridinoline concentrations were measured at baseline and at 12 and 24 mo in the Ca milk (n = 43), CaD milk (n = 44), and control (n = 41) groups. Results: After adjustment for pubertal status and clustering by school, 24-mo supplementation led to greater increases in periosteal diameter (1.2\%) and cortical thickness (5.7\%) and to smaller gains in medullary diameter (6.7\%) than did the control (P {$<$} 0.05). The CaD milk group had lower serum BAP at 12 mo (19.9\%) and lower serum PTH at 12 (46.2\%) and 24 (16.4\%) mo than did the control group (P {$<$} 0.05). The effect of milk supplementation on increasing IGF-I concentrations at 24 mo (16.7-23.3\%) was significant in individual analyses but not after adjustment for clustering by school. Conclusions: Milk supplementation showed positive effects on periosteal and endosteal apposition of cortical bone. {\copyright} 2005 American Society for Clinical Nutrition.}

  abstract = {Summary.{\enspace} We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p{$\gg$}n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},
